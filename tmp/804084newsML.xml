<p>The Indian government has asked Queen Elizabeth to avoid the Punjab city of Amritsar during her official visit in October because of a massacre which took place there in 1919.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral revealed the request in an interview published in the Observer newspaper on Sunday.</p>
<p>He said India was anxious to avoid bitterness over the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, in which hundreds of Indian civilians were mown down by British troops, marring the Queen's visit to mark the 50th anniversary of Indian independence.</p>
<p>India was known as the &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; of the British empire before it won independence in 1947.</p>
<p>The Queen had been due to visit Amritsar to go to the Golden Temple of the Sikhs there.</p>
<p>But Gujral said: &quot;We have suggested as a government to the British a few days back that it would be much better if she (the Queen) doesn't visit Amritsar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a goodwill visit and we would not like to add anything historically that would cause bitterness.&quot;</p>
<p>Gujral said that 50 years after independence, relations between Britain and India were generally good.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;Sometimes some shadow is cast by indiscreet speeches. I do hope in the interest of building better psychological relations, policymakers in London will be slightly more careful and respectful of our sentiments.&quot;</p>
