<p>Norway's Lasse Kjus was denied a victory in men's Alpine skiing World Cup downhill on Saturday when the race was declared invalid because the minimum number of skiers were unable to complete the run.</p>
<p>Gusting winds had delayed the start of the race by 90 minutes and then brought about its abrupt conclusion when two racers, Switzerland's Markus Herrmann and Austria's Roland Assinger, were flagged down before they could complete their run.</p>
<p>The required number of racers, 30, left the start hut but because the two did not get an opportunity to restart the race it was not declared official.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a brief lull in the conditions, Kjus rocketed down the 2,641 metres Olympiabakken course in a time of one minute 28.07 seconds, almost one second faster than Austria's Patrick Ortlieb, who was lying second with 1:29.03.</p>
<p>Canada's Ed Podivinsky, who claimed a bronze medal on the same course at the 1992 Olympics, was third quickest in 1:29.19.</p>
<p>The race has been rescheduled for 0800 GMT on Sunday followed by the scheduled super-G at 1200 GMT.</p>
