<p>Wired Ventures Inc., the publishing company that launched Wired Magazine, the chronicle of the digital age, expects to become profitable in the first part of 1998, a company official said.</p>
<p>The official, chief financial officer Jeff Simon, told investors in a presentation to the Robertson Stephens &amp; Co. technology conference the company expects Wired Magazine to turn a profit this year.</p>
<p>Wired also has HotWired online services, HotBot search engine and HardWired book publisher.</p>
<p>Simon said Wired lost $27 million in 1996, excluding one-time non-cash items. Revenues for the year grew to $37.8 million, a jump of 50 percent from the prior year, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;That will be the biggest number you see going forward,&quot; in terms of financial losses, he added, noting the company had invested heavily to launch new products in 1996.</p>
<p>The online business grew to 16 percent of revenues in 1996 and will eventually reach about 60 percent of total revenues, he said. HotWired is expected to be profitable in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>In the future, Wired plans to focus on the Wired brand, building the company through joint ventures and licensing to add additional revenue at marginal cost, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Much of successful media is about brand,&quot; he said. &quot;Wired is a well-known and untapped brand.&quot;</p>
<p>Wired twice pulled an intended initial public offering in 1996, and announced in January it had completed a $21.5 million equity private placement. The company currently employs more than 300 people.</p>
