<p>The U.S. embassy in Tirana said on Saturday it was worried about reports of violence in Albania and called on all political forces to show restraint and begin a dialogue to tackle the crisis facing the country.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. embassy in Tirana expresses its deep concern over the reports of violence in Vlore and elsewhere over the past several days,&quot; the embassy said in a statement. &quot;Our condolences go out to the victims of this violence and their families.&quot;</p>
<p>The bodies of three protesters in Vlore and one officer of the Shik secret police were seen by reporters at the town mortuary. The Shik said five more of its officers were also killed in the Friday night clashes.</p>
<p>&quot;While the government has a special responsibility for ensuring civil liberties, all sides must show restraint in speech and action to lessen the potential for violence,&quot; the U.S. statement added.</p>
<p>Despite the opposition Forum for Democracy calling off a planned protest in Tirana on Saturday, around 3,000 protesters gathered at a soccer pitch near the city centre. Riot police around the field did not intervene but blocked off a street leading to the main Skanderbeg Square.</p>
<p>&quot;While the United States has a strong interest in the progress of democracy in Albania, the development of this democracy is the responsibility of the Albanians themselves. Violence and extreme speech have no role in this process,&quot; the U.S. embassy said.</p>
