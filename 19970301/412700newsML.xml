<p>Fourteen-year-old mighty mite Tara Lipinski, the recently-crowned U.S. figure skating champion, turned in another flawless performance Friday to take the lead after the women's short programme at the Champion Series Final.</p>
<p>Lipinski nailed every one of her required elements Friday to again upstage world champion Michelle Kwan, who lost her U.S. title to the diminutive Lipinski two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm first,&quot; said the 4-foot-8 (1.42 m) Lipinski, flashing a million dollar smile as she watched her name appear in the number one spot on the electronic scoreboard.</p>
<p>&quot;I like the marks and the boos,&quot; said her coach Richard Callaghan of the crowd reaction to scores which ranged from 5.4 to 5.7. &quot;That means you're a crowd favourite.&quot;</p>
<p>For the 16-year-old Kwan, who won this title last year, it was another bad day at the office.</p>
<p>Kwan fell on the front end of her planned triple lutz-double toe jump combination and was forced to settle for third place heading into Saturday's free skate.</p>
<p>&quot;I was waiting for the perfect take-off and I missed it, I guess. I still have (the final) to go for it all,&quot; said Kwan.</p>
<p>In second place was Russian national champion Maria Butyrskaya, who collected first-place rankings from the Russian and Ajerbaijani judges, while the other five preferred Lipinski's performance.</p>
<p>The six skaters who accumulated the most points from the six-meet Champions Series qualifed for this event.</p>
<p>&quot;Going against the best in the world, I trained hard to have confidence and do my job the best I can,&quot; Lipinski said.</p>
<p>Lipinski's training partner, men's world champion Todd Eldredge, didn't fare as well as his young friend.</p>
<p>The American stumbled on the landing of his triple lutz and fell to one knee. The judges made the necessary point deductions, leaving Eldredge third after the short programme.</p>
<p>That was fine with the crowd, which was solidly behind local favourite and twice world champoin Elvis Stojko, who put on his usual display of technical brilliance to rank first on four of the seven judges' cards.</p>
<p>The other three judges gave the nod to the Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov of Russia who stood second.</p>
<p>Eldredge, however, was the only one of the six contenders to land a triple-triple combination -- an axel-toe loop. Stojko and Urmanov only managed to tack doubles onto their triple Axels.</p>
<p>&quot;I was disappointed I didn't do the triple-triple. I've been doing it all week and did two on the warm-up,&quot; said Stojko, who plans to attempt his impressive quadruple toe jump for Saturday's final.</p>
<p>&quot;I felt really good about the programme, though,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the pairs event, four-time German national champions Mandy Wotzel and Ingo Steuer, who earned world silver last season, took the early lead over Russians Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev.</p>
<p>Third in the pairs was Russia's reigning world champions Marina Eltsova and Andrei Bushkov, who lost points with his stumble on the landing of their side-by-side triple jumps.</p>
<p>An interesting battle was developing in the ice dance event with Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz in a see-saw struggle for first with Russians Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov.</p>
<p>Bourne and Kraatz led after the five couples had skated their compulsory dance, The Golden Waltz. But the Russian duo scored more points in the original dance segment of the three-part competition and took over the lead going into Saturday's free dance final.</p>
<p>Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France stood third.</p>
