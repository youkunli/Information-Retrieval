<headline>HORSE RACING-JOCKEY CARSON SAID TO BE QUITTING.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Willie Carson, badly injured in a racecourse paddock accident last September, has told a tabloid newspaper his riding days are over.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I am an ex-jockey. I just can't push this old body any more,&quot; the 54-year-old former champion was quoted telling Sunday's News of the World.</p>
<p>Carson, who has ridden four Epsom Derby winners, said: &quot;I have ripped something in my back and it is giving me trouble. I had it last year before the accident and now it is back. It was the signal for me to quit.&quot;</p>
<p>The ebullient Scotsman, whose liver was split when a horse lashed out at him, has ridden more than 3,500 winners and been champion jockey five times.</p>
<p>He has ridden 14 English classic winners including an effortless Epsom Derby triumph on Troy in 1979.</p>
