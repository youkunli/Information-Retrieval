<p>The death toll after a tourist-packed pleasure boat capsized in Manila Bay has risen to seven after police retrieved the body of a four-year-old Hong Kong boy, the Philippine Navy said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Thirty nine others, mostly Hong Kong Chinese nationals and four Filipinos, had been rescued, Navy spokesman Salvador Cuba told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The description matches that of the four-year old Hong Kong Chinese national who was reported missing. But we have asked the parents to identify the body,&quot; Cuba told Reuters by phone.</p>
<p>Rescuers also fished out early on Saturday two floating bodies in the bay.</p>
<p>Four bodies, were retrieved Friday, including that of a 12-year old boy, after huge waves and strong winds overturned King Rogers.</p>
<p>All six were Hong Kong Chinese.</p>
<p>&quot;A Hong Kong national hugged the dead body of his wife and cried like a child after we retrived the body from the sea,&quot; a Navy officer told reporters.</p>
<p>The survivors of the accident wailed along the shores of Manila Bay as buddhist monks chanted prayers and lighted incense for the dead early on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor said the five-tonne, double-decked boat was rocked by high waves ten minutes after it left the pier.</p>
<p>The King Rogers had only moved about 30 feet from the shore before it capsized, Gabor said, quoting one survivor.</p>
<p>The owner of the outrigger told reporters that the holiday-makers, who were planning to watch the sunset in the bay, had panicked as the boat began rocking on its way back to port.</p>
<p>&quot;The guests panicked. They all went to one side of the boat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The boat suddenly tipped (after)...the passenger rushed to the right side of the boat....I was shocked,&quot; said the captain, Romeo Farolan.</p>
<p>Many of the passengers were able to grab life jackets before the boat turned over.</p>
<p>Gabor said 42 tourists, mostly from Hong Kong, were on board when the boat capsized.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's accounted for now, there were 42 tourists on board, two Filipino crew, and two other Filipino guides,&quot; Cuba said. The Philippine Coast Guard said it will investigate if the boat was overloaded.</p>
<p>The Manila Bay accident was the third ferry accident in the country in 24 hours.</p>
<p>On Friday, eleven were killed after high waves buffeted another inter-island ferry off Biliran province, 480 km (298 miles) south of Manila.</p>
<p>At least three people drowned and a boy was missing after strong winds and high waves sank another outrigger off the coast of Masbate island late on Thursday, officials said.</p>
<p>Ferry accidents are common in this archipelago where monsoon rains lash the Philippine islands for about five months every year.</p>
