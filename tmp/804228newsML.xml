<p>The Buddhist leader at the the center of a fund-raising scandal over alleged illegal contributions to the Democratic Party said he was not seeking political favors for his donations, the Los Angeles Times reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Venerable Master Hsing Yun, who raised $140,000 for the Democratic National Committee during a luncheon attended by Vice President Al Gore during the 1996 presidential campaign, said his temple's donation was made to thank the United States for its long support of Taiwan .</p>
<p>The Buddhist leader made the comments in a written statement to Senate investigators, obtained by the Los Angeles Times. The statement was turned over to the investigators earlier this summer in Taiwan, the paper said.</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that, in the statement, the 70-year-old monk and founder of the Hsi Lai Temple in the Los Angeles suburb of Hacienda Heights said the fund-raiser for Gore had no political agenda and was aimed at building mainstream acceptance of Buddhism in America.</p>
<p>The temple is at the center of a scandal because it solicited donations from clerics, nuns and devotees at the temple and then reimbursed them with funds from the temple's bank account.</p>
<p>By doing this the temple effectively donated $50,000 to the DNC while keeping its identity concealed. Federal election law prohits concealing the identity of a donor.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not quite understand American law,&quot; Yun said in the statement. &quot;You can correct us and we will mend our ways.&quot;</p>
<p>The document contradicts earlier theories that the donations came from foreign sources and fails to shed new light on Democratic fund-raisers John Huang and Maria Hsia who reportedly solicited the temple donations.</p>
