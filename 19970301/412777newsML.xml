<p>Closing prices on the European vegetable oils market were little changed from midday on Friday after a quiet afternoon.</p>
<p>Palm oil prices were consolidating after export figures released by two Malaysian cargo surveyors were in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>Cargo surveyor Caleb Brett put Malaysia's February bulk palm oil exports at 455,317 tonnes against its estimate of 616,372 for January, traders said.</p>
<p>Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) Malaysia Sdn Bhd said it estimated Malaysia's palm oil exports for February at 453,287 tonnes against 586,046 in January.</p>
<p>&quot;The export figures were just about what we were expecting and now the market is trying to consolidate while we wait to see what happens next week,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said with falling exports and rising output in the coming weeks the price of palm oil should come down....&quot;But you can never tell what the speculators will do next,&quot; said one.</p>
<p>Soft oil attracted some interest during the afternoon with rape oil trading at 100 guilders for Mar and 101.50 guilders per 100 kilos fob ex-mill for Apr.</p>
<p>However, traders said there was little volume behind the trades.</p>
<p>Soy oil closed one guilder up and rape oil one to 0.50 guilders higher, unchanged from midday.</p>
<p>Crude palm oil closed $2.50 up to $2.50 down while products were $2.50 to $5 higher, also unchanged from the morning.</p>
<p>Coconut oil prices eased during the afternoon to end $2.50 to $5 down after Jan/Feb traded at $77.50 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Palmkmernel oil lost $2.50 to $5 on the day but was not traded.</p>
