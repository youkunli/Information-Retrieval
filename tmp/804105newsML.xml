<title>KENYA: Four killed in Kenya violence.</title>
<headline>Four killed in Kenya violence.</headline>
<dateline>MTWAPA, Kenya 1997-08-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Four people were killed in sporadic violence northeast of the port city of Mombasa overnight, raising the death toll in four days of violence to 25, police sources said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police had earlier told Reuters that only one person had died but the figure was revised after they received more information on the incident at Mtwapa, a tourist village 15 km (nine miles) northeast of Mombasa.  </p>
<p>Police said a total of 31 people have been injured in the violence which broke out on Wednesday night and triggered a major military operation to hunt down the attackers. One night club and a tourist lodge were burnt down in Mtwapa by the unknown attackers.</p>
<p>&quot;I evacuated four tourists from the lodge and moved them to my house where they spent the night,&quot; said lodge owner Margaret Shundu.</p>
<p>Police have rounded up scores of people in connection with the violence whose motive is still unknown. In the first wave of attacks on Wednesday night at least 15 people were killed including seven police officers.</p>
