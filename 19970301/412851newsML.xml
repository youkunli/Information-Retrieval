<p>Thousands of protesters, hurling stones, clashed with outnumbered riot police in Tirana on Saturday and overturned two police vehicles in the latest outbreak of violence in Albania, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Around 5,000 demonstrators, chanting &quot;Freedom!&quot; and &quot;Democracy!&quot; marched from a soccer pitch towards the capital's university campus. Riot police scattered and sought refuge in a residential area near the campus, the witnesses said.  </p>
<p>The demonstrators had gathered at the site of a rally planned by the opposition Forum for Democracy, which groups 11 opposition parties. But the Forum had called off the rally after the interior ministry withdrew permission citing tension in the country.</p>
<p>Protesters threw stones at the police who had taken up position on the university campus. Police responded by hurling the stones back in an exchange lasting some 20 minutes and then withdrew from the campus. One student was reported to have been slightly hurt by a stone.</p>
<p>Scores of students who had watched the clash from their dormitory windows later joined the demonstrators. The protest came just hours after a gun battle in the southern town of Vlore where up to nine people were reported tohave been killed.</p>
