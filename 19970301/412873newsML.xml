<p>Mexico on Saturday braced for a fresh onslaught from critics in the U.S. Congress of its drugs record as an embarassing new scandal loomed with the escape from police custody of a top drug boss.</p>
<p>Just hours before President Bill Clinton made up his mind on Friday to certify Mexico's anti-narcotics efforts, Humberto Garcia Abrego, brother of jailed cocaine kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego, mysteriously walked out of police custody.</p>
<p>In a statement late on Friday, the attorney general's office said Garcia Abrego had been under questioning on money-laundering charges at the National Institute for Combatting Drugs when &quot;inexplicably&quot; he left the building.</p>
<p>But in an apparent attempt at damage control, it kept the news quiet until after Clinton had made his announcement.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported police began a nationwide search for Garcia Abrego's black car. The attorney general's office said it launched a investigation to find out why he was let go, and two officials were under arrest.</p>
<p>The escape, which took place either late on Thursday or early on Friday, was bound to embarrass Mexico and provide further fuel for critics of drug corruption.</p>
<p>Allegations in U.S. newspapers of top-level government links to drug-traffickers in Mexico deeply stung Mexicans in the cays prior to Clinton's certification announcement.</p>
<p>Mexican newspapers on Saturday, though clearly relieved at Clinton's decision, warned that there could be more mud-slinging to come as legislators from both parties in the U.S. Congress seek to overturn Clinton's ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though the wicked process still requires the Congress of that country to ratify the president's decision, it is likely to be difficult for the lawmakers to change the executive's view,&quot; the government daily El Nacional said in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, we should continue to expect a torrent of insults and recriminations against our country by the reactionary, isolationist and anti-Mexican legislators.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico, like other Latin American nations, deeply resents the certification process, seeing it as a counterproductive and unilateral measure that ignores the fact that the United States is the biggest drugs consumer.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time since Washington started grading the anti-narcotics efforts of foreign nations, Mexico's certification appeared to be in jeopardy after it announced earlier this month that it had jailed its top anti-drugs warrior on narcotics corruption charges.</p>
<p>In a scramble to avoid humilation abroad, the Mexican government rushed to defend its drugs record, even as it sought to persuade Mexicans back home that it was fully opposed to the certification process.</p>
<p>Mexican opposition parties accused the government of bowing to a series of conditions to win Clinton's approval, including that of allowing U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents to carry arms in Mexico. The government denied such a deal was struck.</p>
<p>On Saturday a senior White House official said the Mexican government was expected to demonstrate progress on a variety of fronts in order to justify its approval as an ally in the drugs war.</p>
<p>He said U.S. officials had been engaged in extensive discussions with the government and police in the last couple of weeks to improve cooperation.</p>
