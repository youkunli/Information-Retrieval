<title>HUNGARY: Run on Hungary's Postabank continues at weekend.</title>
<headline>Run on Hungary's Postabank continues at weekend.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Thousands of people queued on Saturday for a second day to withdraw money from Postabank, one of Hungary's largest banks, despite government assurances that it was sound.</p>
<p>&quot;We have had so many disappointments that we cannot believe half of what the government says,&quot; one man queuing outside a Postabank office told Hungarian radio. &quot;I'd rather keep my money under my pillow.&quot;</p>
<p>The bank, which has some four million listed deposits in branch offices throughout the country, including in post offices, was hit by a run that began on Friday after rumours circulated in Budapest that it had suffered big losses. Offices were opened for the weekend to accomodate customers.</p>
<p>The national news agency MTI and Hungarian newspapers said that some 10 billion forints had been withdrawn from the bank in one day.</p>
<p>But National Bank of Hungary president Gyorgy Suranyi said Postabank remained sound and added that he did not believe the run would have a ripple effect undermining the rest of the Hungarian banking industry.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority of the money that is taken out of Postabank appears in the other banks, so from the standpoint of the whole system stability is not a question,&quot; Suranyi told Hungarian radio in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;In addition, Postabank has extremely significant liquidity reserves...and of course the National Bank can be at their disposal.</p>
<p>&quot;So I believe that taking into consideration the size of the bank and the liquidity, it cannot create an insecurity question as to the total system.&quot;</p>
<p>Bank regulators have said Postabank has assets of some 70 billion forints ($400 million) which could be liquidated quickly to cover the withdrawals.</p>
