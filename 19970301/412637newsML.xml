<p>Kenya's Safari Rally lived up to its reputation as the toughest event on the championship calendar as German Armin Schwarz led home a depleted field at the end of an accident-filled first day on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Ford driver, who had predicted that the key to success would simply be staying out of trouble, capitalised on the misfortunes of others to take the lead at the end of the third stage.</p>
<p>Briton Richard Burns, making his first appearance of the season with Mitsubishi, lay in second position despite suffering clutch problems. His compatriot Colin McRae was third and reigning champion Tommi Makinen of Finland fourth.</p>
<p>Local Kenyan favourite Ian Duncan led the rally after the first stage, but a strut failure caused him to slip back to fifth and allowed Makinen to seize the lead.</p>
<p>But on the third stage Makinen suffered a puncture after hitting one of the many rocks on the roads, costing him five minutes and handing the initiative to Schwarz.</p>
<p>Schwarz's team mate and current world championship leader, Carlos Sainz of Spain, was forced out in the second stage when he swerved to avoid an animal and plunged off the road. Although he repaired a punctured tyre, dust had damaged his car's wheel nuts and forced him to withdraw.</p>
<p>The three-day event centred around Nairobi is unique in that all its competitive stages take place on open public roads. This has forced teams to use helicopters to fly ahead of the cars to warn them of hazards on the roads.</p>
<p>&quot;The conditions are unbelievable. This year the rally is very, very dry, but it still makes the conditions incredibly tough and unpredictable,&quot; said Sweden's Kenneth Eriksson, who was the first high-profile casualty of the day.</p>
<p>The winner of this year's Swedish Rally dropped out at the end of the first stage after leaving the service area too late following accident damage repair.</p>
<p>&quot;I was going quite slowly over a crest and there was this big stone. We tried to avoid it but it was too late and it took the wheel off the car.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite being 50 kilometres from the end of the stage, Eriksson was able to continue with three wheels on his Subaru, even reaching speeds of up to 120 kph, but the repairs took too long.</p>
<p>With only three of the rally title contenders left in the event, drivers were predicting that further retirements were likely to follow in the two remaining days as conditions change.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow, the rally is going to get a lot more bumpy,&quot; said second-place Burns. &quot;It is going to be a real test for our shock-absorbers and there will not be so much of a worry about punctures.&quot;</p>
<p>That will come as good news to Makinen, who encountered no mechanical problems during the opening day but suffered a number of punctures.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have lost about 15 minutes because of that,&quot; he said. &quot;The surface is very dry out there and there are a lot of sharp rocks. That means the car is sliding around more than we would like it to.&quot;</p>
<p>All the teams were likely to take advantage of the longer end-of-day service period on Saturday evening for major repair work before Sunday's five stages in the north of Nairobi.</p>
