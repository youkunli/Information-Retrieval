<p>Lee Janzen, Davis Love and a host of others are battling for the last major tournament prize of the season at the PGA Championship, but there is another prize -- a U.S. Ryder Cup berth -- also at stake.</p>
<p>Janzen carried a one-stroke lead over Love into Saturday's third round at Winged Foot with his sights set on adding the PGA crown to the U.S. Open title he won in 1993 at Baltusrol.</p>
<p>At the same time, the 32-year-old Janzen, who was passed over as a captain's pick two years ago for the Ryder team, feels that only a victory in the PGA will ensure him a spot on the U.S. team that will face Europe at Valderrama next month.</p>
<p>The top 10 players on the points list at the end of this tournament automatically qualify. Captain Tom Kite will make his two wild-card picks known on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there's only one way I think I can make the Ryder Cup team and that's to win,&quot; said Janzen, who has seven tournament titles to his credit but has not won in two years.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that's somewhat a good position. I've got nothing to lose. I've just go to play to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Even a victory would fall short of putting Janzen into the top 10, but it would be a very strong argument put to Kite, who said he was hoping someone would &quot;step up&quot; and show him he should be a captain's pick.</p>
<p>Two years ago at Riviera, Janzen failed to produce a good enough finish to qualify on his own for his first Ryder Cup team and U.S. captain Lanny Wadkins passed him over to select Fred Couples and Curtis Strange, a controversial pick made to add experience to the team.</p>
<p>&quot;At Riviera I had to finish no worse than fifth by myself or with one person, so the whole week that's all I was trying to do,&quot; said Janzen, who tied for 23rd at Riviera while playing with one eye on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>&quot;It was kind of ridiculous. So I should just go out and play to win.&quot;</p>
<p>Only four players -- Tiger Woods, Tom Lehman, Justin Leonard and Jim Furyk -- had clinched berths coming in, although Phil Mickelson and Mark O'Meara appear to be set.</p>
<p>Love has played twice on Ryder Cup teams and while he is keen to join the effort to wrest the cup away from Europe, he said he is focussing on winning his first major championship at the PGA.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a Q-school for the Ryder Cup,&quot; said Love, who began the tournament in 10th place in the standings. &quot;This is a major and I want to win it.&quot;</p>
<p>One spot behind Love and just out of the automatic qualifiers coming into the PGA was Jeff Maggert, who was making a run at joining the team. He stood tied for third after shooting successive 69s for a two-under 138 total.</p>
<p>Fred Couples, sitting in 16th place, is a veteran of four Ryder Cup teams, but has had a difficult year dealing with personal problems that have limited his playing schedule. Couples's father is suffering from leukemia and the golfer's girlfriend is battling breast cancer.</p>
<p>With the Ryder Cup looming, Couples has rediscovered his form and was also in the group of seven tied at 138, two shots behind Janzen.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't go up to Tom Kite and say, 'Tom, I want to play. Put me on the team,'&quot; said Couples. &quot;If I play well enough, he'll think about it, and if he thinks hard enough he may choose me. &quot;If I play like I'm capable of playing, I think I can play some good golf.&quot;</p>
<p>Brad Faxon, Scott Hoch, Tommy Tolles, Paul Stankowski, David Duval and Steve Jones were also in the hunt among others for Ryder places.</p>
<p>One thing is clear -- there is much at stake in the final two rounds at Winged Foot.</p>
<p>&quot;If you play well enough to make the team, then it's an honor,&quot; said Janzen about his outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;And if you don't play well enough to make the team, then I'll be glued to the TV, watching and rooting.&quot;</p>
