<p>The space shuttle Discovery picked up a free-flying satellite on Saturday, ending a nine-day health check on Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<p>The satellite, named CRISTA-SPAS, was plucked from orbit by the shuttle's 60-foot (18-metre) long robot arm at 11:13 a.m. EDT (1513 GMT), as the two craft soared 185 miles (296 km) above the Pacific, north of New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;Good job, Discovery,&quot; mission control's Ellen Ochoa said. &quot;Congratulations on a very smoothly rendezvous and grapple.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;CRISTA'S done a fantastic job and we're proud to carry her,&quot; mission commander Curt Brown said later.</p>
<p>Astronaut Jan Davis, operating the robot arm, then gently lowered the 7,000-pound (3,200-kg) spacecraft into its berth in the shuttle's cargo bay.</p>
<p>The German-built satellite, which was released by the astronauts last week, has been probing Earth's atmosphere to learn more about the depletion of the ozone layer.</p>
<p>The mission's scientists said they were delighted with the early results from CRISTA-SPAS.</p>
<p>The satellite's two main instruments made nearly 50,000 atmospheric observations at altitudes ranging from 4.3 to 115 miles (7 to 185 km).</p>
<p>&quot;It was simply an absolute success,&quot; said Klaus Grossmann of the University of Wuppertal, Germany.</p>
<p>The spacecraft's most surprising finding was evidence of much more water vapor in the upper atmosphere than scientists had expected. The results seem to back a controversial theory that the Earth is being bombarded by house-sized, water-laden comets thousands of times a day.</p>
<p>&quot;In the sense of going exploring and finding a gold mine, I have to say I think we found it,&quot; scientist Robert Conway of the Naval Research Laboratory said.</p>
<p>The only disappointment was that the shuttle's power reserves would not allow an extra day of observations, the researchers told a news conference.</p>
<p>The scientists were eager to get their hands on the data recorded aboard the spacecraft. Only a fraction of its atmospheric measurements were transmitted to the ground.</p>
<p>About 30 gigabytes of information are stored on the spacecraft's recorders, enough to fill about half a ton of computer floppy disks, Conway said.</p>
<p>Discovery is due to return to earth on Monday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Weather conditions are expected to be favorable for the planned landing at about 7:05 a.m. EDT (1105 GMT), NASA officials said.</p>
