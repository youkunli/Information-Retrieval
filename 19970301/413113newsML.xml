<p>Icy winds swept across Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan on Saturday, adding to the problems of survivors of a severe earthquake that killed at least 50 people the day before.</p>
<p>Pakistan's new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the area by helicopter after bad weather had earlier prevented him and President Farooq Leghari from landing.</p>
<p>Government officials confirmed 50 people had died and said more than 100 had also been injured in house collapses and mudslides triggered by the quake that hit the region bordering Iran and Afghanistan in the early hours of Friday.</p>
<p>But the private Edhi ambulance centre in Quetta, the provincial capital, reported 65 deaths, and local newspapers put the figure up to 100.</p>
<p>The officials said the death toll could rise beyond 50 as information on casualties had still not been received from some stricken villages in the difficult mountainous terrain, where mudslides had blocked road access to some 250 trapped familes.</p>
<p>The authorities have sent four-wheel drive vehicles to remote villages in the worst-hit Harnai sub-district with food, medicines tents and volunteer doctors, they said.</p>
<p>Good news for relief workers was the restoration of the damaged rail track to Harnai town, state radio said.</p>
<p>The earthquake woke residents with a roar at 2.10 a.m. on Friday (2110 GMT Thursday). Another big jolt followed 20 minutes later and milder tremors continued for two hours, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The highest casualties occurred in three villages near Harnai town, about 100 km (63 miles) east of Quetta, where at least 40 people were killed and about 100 injured, a senior provincial government official said.</p>
<p>The official APP news agency quoted provincial home department secretary Ashraf Nasir as saying more than 200 families had been badly affected there while hundreds of houses, including mud structures, collapsed.</p>
<p>Three people were killed in Quetta and five in the town of Sibi, to the southeast, local officials said. One person died in the town of Bhag and one in Mithri village, also southeast of Quetta.</p>
<p>A government seismic centre in the northwestern town of Peshawar measured the earthquake at 6.2 on the open-ended Richter scale. It placed the epicentre in the Koh-i-Suleman mountain range, north of Quetta, near the Afghan border.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Centre in Golden, Colorado, put it at 7.3 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>Quetta was destroyed by an earthquake on May 31, 1935 that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and killed 30,000 people.</p>
