<p>One crewman was killed in a fire aboard a cruise ship carrying more than 1,100 people, Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) said on Saturday.</p>
<p>It said in a statement the crewman, whom it did not identify, was found dead in the engine room of the 20,000 gross tonne SuperStar Gemini after the fire there was put out early on Saturday.</p>
<p>The MPA said an investigation was under way into the fire, which cut short a two-day cruise soon after the liner set out from Singapore.</p>
<p>Star Cruises, operator of the Panama-registered vessel, said the ship carried 689 passengers and 472 crew.</p>
<p>A company official said most of the passengers on board the ship heading for the Malaysian port of Malacca were Singaporean, Australian and Malaysian.</p>
<p>Another company ship, the Star Aquarius, was sent to help but was not needed and the Gemini returned to Singapore early on Saturday and the passengers disembarked, Star Cruises said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement said it would refund the full cruise fare and the passengers would be offered a free trip.</p>
