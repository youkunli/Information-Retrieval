<text>
<p>Two New York nurses accused a hospital of firing them for refusing to perform abortions, a charge hospital officials denied Friday.</p>
<p>Deborah Larson and Christine Thornton, licensed practical nurses, filed a lawsuit Thursday in Albany County Supreme Court seeking to regain their jobs at the Albany Medical Centre.</p>
<p>In their lawsuit, they claim they gave written notice in October that they would not do abortion procedures because the procedures violated their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, they were cited for insubordination  and then fired, their attorney, Michael McDermott, said.</p>
<p>Hospital officials denied that the two nurses were fired over the abortion issue.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always respected that employees should only do something in good conscience,&quot; said hospital spokesman Rich Puff. &quot;The allegations they are making are totally false.&quot;</p>
<p>The nurses' lawsuit seeks back pay, benefits and punitive damages. Larson had been employed at the hospital for 21 years and Thornton had been there for 18 months.</p>
