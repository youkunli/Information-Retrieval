<p>Croat authorities allowed a group of Moslem refugees to return to their homes in central Bosnia on Saturday after drunken mobs expelled them two weeks ago, a United Nations spokesman said.</p>
<p>More than 80 Moslems travelled in two buses to the village of Kruscica near the central town of Jajce without incident, spokesman Alun Roberts said, citing reports from U.N. police monitors.</p>
<p>Several hundred Moslems were forced to flee the Jajce area by hostile Croat mobs earlier this month in an incident which drew international condemnation.</p>
<p>U.N. relief officials and Western mediators brokered an agreement this week between Croat and Moslem authorities which called for the refugees to return to Jajce this month.</p>
<p>International police officers patrolled Jajce by helicopter on Saturday afternoon and found the area &quot;stable and calm&quot;, Roberts said by telephone from the northwestern town of Banja Luka.</p>
<p>More Moslem families were due to move back to their pre-war homes around Jajce over the next several days, he said.</p>
<p>U.N. police monitors managed to defuse a tense confrontation in the nearby village of Guca Gora on Saturday when about 40 Croats demanded permission to return to their homes which now lie in Moslem-controlled territory.</p>
<p>Moslem police eventually allowed the Croats to visit their former homes, Roberts said.</p>
<p>A 1995 peace treaty grants Moslem, Croat and Serb refugees the right to return to their homes but nationalist authorities have tended to permit only members of their own ethnic community to move back.</p>
<p>Moslems and Croats fought a 10-month war for territory in 1993 and later formed a federation which covers half of Bosnia.</p>
<p>Major powers have offered generous reconstruction aid to municipal authorities who comply with the peace treaty's provisions on refugee returns.</p>
<p>Following international pressure, Croat authorities in central Bosnia have recently shifted their stance and begun allowing Moslems to move back to their homes.</p>
<p>But Bosnian Croat leaders in the western Herzegovina region which borders neighbouring Croatia have steadfastly refused to make good on promises to permit Moslems or Serbs to return.</p>
