<p>European golfers have two more tournaments after the PGA Championship to earn points towards selection, but some prominent players on the bubble blew a golden opportunity this week at Winged Foot.</p>
<p>Ireland's Padraig Harrington (eight-over 148), Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain (152) and Briton Paul Broadhurst (149) -- who stood 11th, 12th and 13th on the Ryder Cup list -- all failed to make the cut at the PGA.</p>
<p>The top 10 players on the list automatically qualify for the team that will defend the cup against the United States next month at Valderrama in Spain.</p>
<p>The most vexing problem likely to face Europe captain Seve Ballesteros was not helped either by the results at Winged Foot. Ballesteros will add two players to the team through his captain's picks and the obvious contenders struggled here.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Spaniard will choose compatriot Olazabal if he fails to qualify on points. The other two top candidates for captain's picks -- Nick Faldo and British Open runner-up Jesper Parnevik -- failed to support their candidacies.</p>
<p>Sweden's Parnevik, who like Faldo plays on the U.S. tour and will not get on the team through points, barely made the cut at six-over 146.</p>
<p>Faldo, the stalwart of 10 Ryder Cup teams, flopped out of the championship after scores of 75 and 78 for a 13-over 153 total.</p>
<p>It was the first time in his stellar career that three-time Masters and British Open champion Faldo, who missed the cut at this summer's British Open, missed two cuts in major championships in the same season.</p>
<p>On the brighter side, several likely European team members played very well at Winged Foot.</p>
<p>Foremost was Italy's Costantino Rocca, who was tied for third place, two shots behind second-round leader Lee Janzen at two-under 138. Rocca began the week in 10th place on the Ryder list.</p>
<p>Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, eighth in the standings, was at even par for the championship, one shot ahead of young Spaniard Ignacio Garrido, who stood in sixth place on the European list.</p>
