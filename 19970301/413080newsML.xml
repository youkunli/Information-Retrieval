<p>Three people were killed by an avalanche on Friday in Engelberg, a popular ski resort in central Switzerland, the Swiss news agency SDA said.</p>
<p>The avalanche engulfed a group of six skiers -- five on snowboards and one on skis -- but three survived after pulling themselves free.</p>
<p>One of the dead, a 58-year-old Swiss, was discovered by rescue crews late on Friday. The other two, a 23-year-old and 27-year-old from the Canton of Zurich, were found during the night, SDA said.</p>
<p>The avalanche on Friday afternoon was triggered by the off-piste skiers themselves.</p>
<p>Jochstock is at the foot of the Titlis mountain, a popular destination for skiers and tourists, especially from Japan.</p>
<p>Full-scale rescue efforts involved around 200 people, 19 dogs and at least five helicopters. Floodlights were used during the night.</p>
<p>Since the start of the skiing season late last year, at least 19 people have been killed in Switzerland by avalanches.</p>
