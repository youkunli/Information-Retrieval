<p>A United Nations germ warfare team has ended a week-long inspection of Iraq's past biological weapons, a U.N. arms official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Jo Lomas, special assistant to the director of Baghdad's Ongoing Monitoring and Verification Centre, said the 12-member team left on Friday.</p>
<p>Under the ceasefire of the 1991 Gulf War, the United Nations Special Commission is entrusted with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction including the biological.</p>
<p>UNSCOM has frequently said that Iraq has not yet revealed all secrets about its past biological warfare capabilities. Baghdad says it has nothing to hide.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the team) were conducting interviews with Iraqi officials involved in the biological programmes,&quot; Lomas told Reuters.</p>
<p>The biological mission which is the second in a month is part of a working plan Iraq has reached with UNSCOM's new chairman Richard Butler last month.</p>
<p>A ballistic missile team is also currently in Iraq conducting inspection to see if Baghdad is still hiding banned rockets in its arsenal. The team arrived on Monday and is expected to stay for another week.</p>
<p>Lomas said Butler was expected to visit Iraq next month to check if the working plan went right.</p>
<p>U.N. curbs on Baghdad's oil exports imposed for Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can not be removed until UNSCOM testifies that Iraq's arms of mass destruction have been annihilated or rendered harmless.</p>
<p>The U.N. has allowed Iraq partial oil exports worth $2 billion over six months to raise money to buy food and medicine for Iraqis. Iraq has started oil exports for the second six months of the deal on Thursday.</p>
