<p>Italy-bound Christian Ziege struck twice as Bayern Munich stayed three points clear at the top of the German first division with a 5-2 thrashing of unglamorous Duisburg on Saturday.</p>
<p>Germany's Euro 96 wing back Ziege, who is joining AC Milan at the end of the season, outsmarted the defence brilliantly for his first goal in the 48th minute and then completed a superb individual performance with his second in the 59th minute.</p>
<p>The Bavarians could even afford the luxury of missing a second-half penalty after first-half goals from German internationals Juergen Klinsmann and Mario Basler and an own goal from the visitors by Markus Reiter in the 53rd minute.</p>
<p>Duisburg goalkeeper Thomas Gill stopped Bayern scoring more when he turned Basler's spot kick onto a post in the 62nd minute.</p>
<p>But despite being without injured midfielders Thomas Strunz and Mehmet Scholl and ill goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, the Bavarians easily stretched their unbeaten run to 12 games with their biggest home win of the season.</p>
<p>&quot;That was a great performance,&quot; Italian coach Giovanni Trapattoni said. &quot;Basler, Klinsmann and Ziege were superb.&quot;</p>
<p>Basler's confident performance was important since the controversial midfielder was fined by the club after criticising Trapattoni's tactics after their recent defeat by Karlsruhe in the German Cup quarter-finals.</p>
<p>His goal was spectacular. The midfielder ran half of the length of the field before firing in a long-range shot into the corner.</p>
<p>Defender Alfred Nijhuis scored two late consolation goals for promoted Duisburg, who have spent more time in the regional leagues and second division in the last decade than in the Bundesliga. But they were outplayed in Munich's Olympic stadium.</p>
<p>Champions Borussia Dortmund were also in goalscoring mood ahead of Wednesday's European Cup quarter-final first leg against France's Auxerre, winning 4-1 at home over middle-of-the-table 1860 Munich and staying second.</p>
<p>Former Germany striker Karlheinz Riedle opened the scoring in the 22nd minute before further goals from Portugese midfielder Paulo Sousa, Swiss Stephane Chapuisat and defender Juergen Kohler completed the rout.</p>
<p>But Bayer Leverkusen, who started the day level on points with Dortmund, lost ground in the race when they could only manage a goalless draw at lowly Fortuna Duesseldorf.</p>
<p>Bayer are now five points behind Bayern, who travel to Leverkusen for a fascinating clash next weekend.</p>
<p>Schalke, who play Valencia of Spain in the UEFA Cup quarter-final first legs on Tuesday, could only manage a goalless draw at home with St Pauli on Friday.</p>
