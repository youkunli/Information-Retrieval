<p>An official Vietnamese newspaper on Saturday said serious abuses of education fees and taxes had been found in a northern province stricken in recent months by some of the country's worst known unrest.</p>
<p>In a frank and detailed admission of official graft, the Lao Dong (Labour) newspaper said prosecutors in Thai Binh province had uncovered evidence that fees collected from schoolchildren were being used by officials for partying and holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;On average each school collects 12 to 15 kinds of fees,&quot; it said. &quot;They have many fees which are not in line with regulations...for example labour fees, hygiene fees, security fees and so on.&quot;</p>
<p>Both district and province level education departments were found to have siphoned off money for a variety of purposes including travel, hosting guests, office celebrations and paying cash bonuses to officials, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;They also used money to upgrade technical tools, to use them for their own purposes,&quot; the article added.</p>
<p>Thai Binh province lies about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Hanoi, in an area of Vietnam viewed historically as the cradle of its communist revolution.</p>
<p>Trouble surfaced there earlier this year when thousands of people converged on the province capital to protest grievances including alleged official graft and new tax demands.</p>
<p>Reports from the area, which has been kept off-limits to foreign journalists, say the situation turned violent in May and June.</p>
<p>The homes of several officials were burnt down and government workers and their families were evacuated after at least one was beaten.</p>
<p>Police and military reinforcements were sent in to restore order, but the situation is reported still tense. Details, including the number of casualties, remain difficult to come by.</p>
<p>Rural unrest is considered a significant concern for Vietnam's communist government, which derives its traditional support from a farming peasantry, who make up around 80 percent of the country's 77 million population.</p>
<p>In addition to the troubles in Thai Binh incidents have been reported in recent months in at least one other northern province.</p>
<p>Vietnam's foreign ministry announced recently that the authorities were taking steps to stabilise the situation, which it blamed on &quot;untransparent&quot; financial activities involving low-level officials, whom it said would be punished.</p>
<p>Since then the government has also announced measures to boost rural incomes and breathe new life into a system of farmers' cooperatives, which largely disappeared following the launch of free-market economic reforms in 1986.</p>
<p>Diplomats in Hanoi say the problem has presented Vietnam's leadership with a critical and sensitive question of how it should tackle such issues without alienating segments of its own population.</p>
<p>The Lao Dong report is one of few in Vietnam's state-controlled media to have referred, albeit indirectly, to the problem. It made no mention of disturbances in Thai Binh or elsewhere.news</p>
