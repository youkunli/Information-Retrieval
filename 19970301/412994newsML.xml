<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat left Gaza on Saturday for Cairo, where he was to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak before continuing to the United States, aides said.</p>
<p>Israel's decision to build a Jewish settlement on an Arab East Jerusalem hilltop was expected to top Arafat's agenda at talk with Mubarak and with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday, they said.</p>
<p>The Palestinian cabinet warned that the Israeli plan could threaten Middle East peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace process cannot go on under the continuation of this settlement assault which aims to swallow Jerusalem,&quot; the cabinet said in a statement issued on Saturday following Friday night's weekly meeting in Gaza.</p>
<p>It issued an appeal to world leaders to oppose the Israeli project they fear blocks Palestinian aspirations to turn East Jerusalem into the capital of a future state. In the 1993 Oslo accords the sides agreed to discuss the final status of the city at peace talks.</p>
<p>The Palestinian cabinet called the planned construction &quot;a flagrant violation of the Oslo accord&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace process is under a threat. The Palestinian leadership calls upon the world community, the United Nations, the two sponsors of the peace process (the United States and Russia), Europe and the Security Council, to stear Israel back to respect and protect the international accords,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Palestinians have held a series of demonstrations at the pine-covered Jabal Abu Ghneim, known by Israelis as Har Homa, where Israel decided to build 6,500 homes for Jews.</p>
<p>Residents of the nearby Arab village Um Tuba said Israel confiscated their portion of the mountain in 1991.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and views all of the city as its capital, a view unrecognised by the international community.</p>
<p>Arafat on Thursday attacked the decision to build as a breach of peace agreements, but he heeded U.S. warnings to keep the lid on violent protests.</p>
