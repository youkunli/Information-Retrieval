<p>African foreign ministers have called for an immediate ceasefire in the spreading war between rebels and government forces in eastern Zaire and withdrawal of all foreign forces, including mercenaries, .</p>
<p>The Organisation of African Unity ministerial council, at the end of a three-day conference in Tripoli on Friday, called a summit on Zaire for March 26 in Togo.</p>
<p>&quot;The council...expresses grave concern over the continuing deterioration of the security situation in the Great Lakes region...(and) calls for the immediate cessation of armed hostilities and the withdrawal of all foreign forces, including mercenaries, from the territory in Zaire,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;In this regard it urges all states neighbouring Zaire as well as states outside the region to desist from getting involved in the conflict presently taking place in eastern Zaire,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Delegates said the council ignored a Zairean government demand to delete wording calling for &quot;the safe and voluntary repatriation from Zaire of the remaining Rwandan refugees&quot; and supporting ongoing peace efforts, including the mission of U.N. and OAU envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.</p>
<p>They said the council also ignored a Zairean demand for the U.N. Security Council to oversee what Kinshasa calls the &quot;withdrawal and disarmament of foreign troops&quot; and deployment of observers along Zaire's borders with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.</p>
<p>Kinshasa accuses the three countries of backing the rebels. The three deny the charge.</p>
<p>Foreign mercenaries are fighting with Zaire's army against Zaire's ethnic Tutsis, who rebelled late last year after local authorities tried to expel them to their ancestral homeland in Rwanda.</p>
<p>OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said an African body in charge of resolving conflicts will meet in Lome, Togo, on March 26 to discuss the situation in the Great Lakes region, especially Zaire.</p>
<p>The Lome summit will be preceeded by a regional summit on Zaire called Nairobi III, to be held in Kenya on March 18-19. It is promoted by South Africa, Zimbabwe, Cameroon and Kenya.</p>
<p>Delegates said Zaire, which didn't attend the two previous Nairobi summits, proposed that Nairobi III include Angola, Chad, Congo and Gabon.</p>
<p>&quot;The OAU only took note of the Nairobi summit. During the debates behind closed doors some ministers had deplored the multiplication of initiatives on eastern Zaire and proposed that they be coordinated within the OAU's conflicts committee,&quot; a delegate told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo assured his colleagues that his country doesn't aim at replacing the OAU's bodies but seeks only to provide Zaireans a place for talks,&quot; he said.</p>
