<text>
<p>Russian Yelena Vialbe won yet another gold at the Nordic skiing world championships by taking Saturday's last women's event, the 30-km, classical style cross-country race.</p>
<p>Vialbe clocked a winning provisional time of one hour 23 minutes 4.90 seconds to win her fifth gold medal in as many women's events in the 10-day festival.</p>
<p>She won the 15-km, the 10-km pursuit and the relay and was awarded gold in the 5-km after compatriot Lyubov Yegorova was stripped of her world title for testing positive for banned stimulant Bromantan.</p>
<p>Vialbe became the first woman to take all the gold medals in one single world championships since Galina Kulakova of the Soviet Union did it in 1974 in Falun, Sweden, where only three women's races were held.</p>
<p>Stefania Belmondo of Italy was second 28.30 seconds back and Marit Mikkelsplass of Norway was third 1:50.80 behind the winner, according to unofficial results.</p>
