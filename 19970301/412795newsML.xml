<p>Home favourite Gaston Kabore of Burkina Faso won Africa's top cinema award on Saturday with his film &quot;Buud Yam&quot;, the tale of a young man on a quest to find a healer to cure his ailing little sister.</p>
<p>The jury at the 15th Ouagadougou Panafrican cinema and television festival in Burkina Faso's capital awarded Kabore's film the coveted Golden Stallion of Yennenga, Africa's equivalent of an Oscar for best film.</p>
<p>A total of 18 feature films from 11 countries vied for the top award at the biennial festival, which this year took as its theme &quot;Cinema, Childhood and Youth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Buud Yam&quot; means the &quot;Will of the Family&quot; in Moore, the language of Burkina Faso's majority Mossi ethnic group.</p>
<p>&quot;The main character of the film undertook a voyage of initiation and everyone makes this type of journey,&quot; Kabore said on receiving the award.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps we don't find happiness every day but the important thing is to stay generous and that's the lesson that the character has for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, who presented the award, urged fellow African leaders to support the cinema. &quot;It is essential that we leaders support the efforts of film makers and actors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Neighbouring Ivory Coast's Jacques Trabi won the award for the best short film with his entry &quot;Bouzie&quot;.</p>
