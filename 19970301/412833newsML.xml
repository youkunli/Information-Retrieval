<p>Protesters armed with handguns and rifles, many shooting in the air, paraded in the southern Albanian town of Vlore on Saturday after a night of bloody anarchy in which at least six people were killed.</p>
<p>Crowds of residents exchanged gunfire with secret police units late on Friday in the most ferocious bout of violence in Albania since food riots in 1991 when 40 people died.</p>
<p>The exchange of fire erupted at the headquarters of the National Information Service, or secret police, known as the Shik, in this ancient Adriatic port town, a clash apparently sparked by a stabbing at the university.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a macabre and tragic night...in Vlore,&quot; the town's hospital director Servet Kojdheli told reporters. &quot;I've never seen anything like this before in Albania.&quot;</p>
<p>Reporters who visited the town morgue saw the bodies of four men, three of them protesters, Fatmir Tozaj, 34, Shkelqim Bogdani, 33, and 17-year-old Artur Zotaj, who had all died from bullet wounds. A witness in the town had earlier incorrectly quoted hospital officials as saying Zataj was 14 years old.</p>
<p>The fourth victim was Shik officer Lek Coku, 36, who had also been shot dead.</p>
<p>The Shik said another of its officers had been gunned down in the shoot-out and described brutal scenes when an angry mob dragged three policemen from their headquarters on the outskirts of town, beating one to death and seriously injuring two others.</p>
<p>&quot;Armed terrorist bands, with more than 27 cars and about 60 to 70 people, attacked the building of the Information Service... at about 9 p.m. (2000 GMT), without any warning, opening fire from four sides of the building with automatic arms and explosive grenades,&quot; the Shik said in a statement.</p>
<p>Witnesses said protesters pursued Shik officers after one of them was believed to have stabbed a civilian outside the university, where 42 students are on hunger strike. The victim was treated for his wounds and later released from hospital.</p>
<p>Students began their action 10 days ago in protest at the ruling Democratic Party government's handling of a pyramid investment scheme scandal in which thousands have lost all their savings.</p>
<p>Scores of protests, many of them led by students and high school pupils, have been held across the former Stalinist state since January over the financial scandal. All want Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi and his government to resign.</p>
<p>After the two-hour gun battle, about 12 Shik officers fled from the two-storey building which was then ransacked by protesters and set ablaze.</p>
<p>Smoke billowed from four blackened rooms and part of the building was still burning on Saturday morning. Pools of blood could be seen on the floors where documents and papers lay scattered.</p>
<p>Around 2,000 men of all ages, nearly all carrying weapons, and some women gathered outside the university and held a one-minute silence for what they called the three martyrs of democracy. The atmosphere was highly charged and was likely to remain so until the three were buried on Sunday.</p>
<p>Reporters in Tirana saw five army trucks early on Saturday driving into the capital, where opposition parties planned to hold an anti-government rally later in the day.</p>
<p>No soldiers were seen in the streets as dawn broke but two trucks and three vans full of riot police were seen travelling towards the centre of the city.</p>
