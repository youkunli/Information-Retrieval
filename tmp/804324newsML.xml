<title>SWITZERLAND: Ravers flock to Europe's number two techno fest.</title>
<headline>Ravers flock to Europe's number two techno fest.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-08-16</dateline>

<p>Up to half a million people swamped Zurich for the annual techno music Street Parade on Saturday, Europe's second-largest techno festival after the Berlin Love Parade.</p>
<p>Techno fans, called ravers, in flashy costumes or scantily clad for hot weather, came from across Europe for the five-hour parade by 30 booming sound trucks along five km (three miles) of the city's lakefront.</p>
<p>&quot;The atmosphere is very good and there are certainly more people than last year,&quot; said a spokesman for the organisors, who have said they expected up to 500,000 ravers and spectators after 300,000 visitors last year.</p>
<p>After the parade, ravers faced a choice between 30 all-night techno parties in sites ranging from the main train station to a forest clearing above the city.</p>
<p>&quot;It has all been peaceful so far,&quot; said a police spokesman in Zurich, Switzerland's biggest city with about one million inhabitants in the wider metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Techno music is a mix of thundering beats and repetitive electronic bleats supplied by disc jockeys equipped with massive sound systems.</p>
<p>Zurich's Street Parade started in 1992, three years after Berlin's Love Parade, and has grown from around 2,000 dedicated ravers the first time. Berlin's Love Parade on July 12 drew up to a million people.</p>
<p>The Zurich festival under the motto &quot;Love, peace and tolerance&quot; is also a financial wellspring, generating sales estimated at around 50 million Swiss francs for everything from music CDs to railroad tickets.</p>
