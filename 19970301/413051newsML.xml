<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe urged Turkey on Saturday to stick to democracy in order to draw closer to Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope Turkey will pursue its path towards Europe because it has a place in the European family,&quot; Juppe told reporters.</p>
<p>He said this meant Ankara should continue building on its democracy &quot;as we have always hoped throughout the long negotiations between the European Union and Turkey.&quot;</p>
<p>He was speaking after a meeting of leaders of the European Democratic Union, an umbrella group of 40 European centre-right political parties.</p>
<p>In Ankara, a military-dominated council delivered a similar message, telling Turkey's Islamist-led government not to stray from the path of democracy and official secularism after weeks of tension between secularist generals and the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Strains escalated after the army sent tanks on manoeuvres through Ankara's Sincan district early in February after an Islamist protest there attended by the Iranian ambassador.</p>
<p>Rumours of a possible coup have been rife but Western diplomats say the generals are reluctant to intervene, partly because Turkey's image abroad would suffer.</p>
