<p>Palestinian police have found the body of a missing Israeli taxi driver in a well in PLO-ruled Jericho, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian police said three Palestinians suspected of murdering 45-year-old Shmuel Ben-Baruch had been arrested by PLO forces.</p>
<p>Palestinian police said Ben-Baruch had been smashed in the head with a stone and stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem-based driver's bloodstained taxi was found on Friday in a wadi in Aqabat Jabr refugee camp on the outskirts of Jericho which Israeli police said was used as a storehouse for stolen vehicles.</p>
<p>Israeli police said the Mercedes taxi had been sold to the storehouse's owner for 7,000 shekels ($2,000).</p>
<p>Israeli police praised their Palestinian counterparts for rapid action in arresting suspects and locating the body.</p>
<p>Palestinian police said the three suspects did not belong to any political organisation. Israeli police said they were investigating both criminal and ''nationalist'' motives for the killing.</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian tension has run high since a double suicide bombing killed 16 people, including the attackers, at a market in Jerusalem on July 30.</p>
<p>Israel has imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from entering the Jewish state.</p>
