<p>Top seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia breezed to an easy 6-0 7-6 (8-6) victory on Saturday over German David Prinosil to reach the final of the $815,000 Milan indoor tennis tournament.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic, who won here last year, raced through the first set in just 14 minutes before finishing off Prinosil in one hour and one minute.</p>
<p>&quot;He missed a lot of balls in the first set and I served very well. But in the second set he improved his tennis and it was a tough match,&quot; Ivanisevic said.</p>
<p>The world number five hit a total of 16 aces, including four in one game.</p>
<p>Prinosil, 59th in the world, improved in the second set and broke Ivanisevic in game seven, but then lost his serve in the following game.</p>
<p>In the tie-break Ivanisevic went down 4-5, but recovered with an ace and never looked back.</p>
<p>The German saved a match point but not the second. &quot;I was playing my best tennis of the year this week, until today,&quot; Prinosil said.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot understand why I played so badly in first set. I did not feel the rhythm of the match,&quot; Prinosil added.</p>
<p>Prinosil defeated three higher-ranked players -- German Michael Stich, Mark Philippoussis of Australia and Petr Korda of Czech Republic -- to reach his first ATP tour semifinal of the year.</p>
<p>Ivanisevic, who has a 21-3 record in the 1997, will face the winner of the other semifinal between Spaniard Sergi Bruguera and German Nicolas Kiefer.</p>
<p>&quot;My aim is not to be number one but to win one Grand Slam tournament,&quot; Ivanisevic added.</p>
