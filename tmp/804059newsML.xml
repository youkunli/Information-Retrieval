<headline>BASEBALL-INDIANS' JACK MCDOWELL TO MISS REST OF SEASON.</headline>
<dateline>CLEVELAND 1997-08-15</dateline>

<p>Former Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell, who has not pitched since May 12, will miss the rest of the season and likely has played his last game for the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>The results of McDowell's recent magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed a nerve injury resulting in the weakness of a small supporting muscle in his right elbow, although improvement was seen in the area of the bone bruise.</p>
<p>He has been advised that he should not throw competitively until the bone bruise has completely healed and strength is restored in the area, which is expected to take six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;The doctors told me that they have never seen anything like this injury,&quot; McDowell said Friday. &quot;They don't really know exactly what happened. Basically, only time will tell. It's a big mystery thing, my arm, this year.&quot;</p>
<p>McDowell was placed on the 15-day disabled list on May 18 with pinching of soft tissue in the lateral side of his right elbow and underwent arthroscopic surgery two days later. Dr James Andrews performed the procedure in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack tried everything under the sun to come back,&quot; manager Mike Hargrove said. &quot;You have to admire Jack for the hard work he put in. Anytime you lose a pitcher of Jack's magnitude, it's tough. We are going to miss him.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the last time we shut him down, I stopped looking for Jack to come back this season.&quot;</p>
<p>McDowell went 3-3 with a 5.09 ERA in eight games this season, including six starts. After the injury-plagued season, it is not likely the Indians will pick up McDowell's $4.8 million option for next season.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that was kind of laid in stone early this season,&quot; said McDowell, who won the 1993 American League Cy Young Award after a 22-10 season with the Chicago White Sox. &quot;It's going to be a tough situation, having missed about an entire season. I'm not going to have any type of multi-year deals put in front of me.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been disappointed in what I've come across and they've been disappointed in what they've come across,&quot; he said of his two years in Cleveland. &quot;It hasn't been a lot of fun. It hasn't been a positive situation for me in a lot of areas.&quot;</p>
