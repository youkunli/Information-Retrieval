<title>CAMBODIA: Hun Sen forces 3km from Cambodian opposition town.</title>
<headline>Hun Sen forces 3km from Cambodian opposition town.</headline>
<dateline>SIEM REAP, Cambodia 1997-08-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Cambodian government forces on Saturday advanced to within three km (1.8 miles) of the last major position held by forces loyal to ousted co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a senior official said.</p>
<p>General Meas Sophea, who heads fighting operations for the government, said he expected the government to seize the opposition-held town of O'Smach on Saturday night or Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are getting closer and closer. Only three km more and we will be in O'Smach,&quot; he told Reuters in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>In Siem Reap, a provincial capital about 100 km (60 miles) south of the front lines, military officials said they were &quot;very close&quot; to O'Smach.</p>
<p>A Reuters cameraman saw more than 27 wounded and sick soldiers flown into Siem Reap for treatment at a military hospital.</p>
<p>Seventeen were wounded by landmines, hospital officials said. Seven, including the Siem Reap division commander, were injured by artillery, and three other troops were seriously ill, the officials said.</p>
<p>At least three government soldiers have been killed, officials said. Royalist casualties are not known.</p>
<p>Villagers in the area said an artillery shell had exploded in the O'Smach market, killing one civilian and wounding two others.</p>
<p>The shell, believed to have been the first fired by government troops closing in on this last major royalist stronghold, exploded around 10.30 am, villagers hoping to cross into neighbouring Thailand told reporters.</p>
<p>Troops loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen are attempting to finish off royalist forces loyal to co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen ousted last month.</p>
<p>Several hundred troops loyal to Hun Sen have been closing in on O'Smach over the last few days, although their advance has been slowed by booby traps, blown bridges, landmines and thick jungle, a military official said.</p>
<p>Thousands of Cambodian villagers from the O'Smach area were poised to cross the border into Thailand, their numbers swelling as the fighting escalated.</p>
<p>The Thai army has pledged to let the villagers cross if the situation warrants it. About 25,000 residents and displaced Cambodians are now estimated to be in the O'Smach area, Thai military sources said.</p>
<p>Some of those crowded against the barbed wire and gates marking the Thai border villages said around 100 Khmer Rouge guerrillas had arrived to reinforce royalist positions on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The guerrillas, some of the last remnants of the once feared Maoist movement, were believed to have travelled from their Anlong Veng base about 50 km to the east of the border town.</p>
<p>On Friday Khmer Rouge radio said the group had formed an alliance with royalist forces in fighting Hun Sen, although Ranariddh denied the report.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's ragged forces have been defending pockets of territory in the country's northwest since Hun Sen seized power after two days of bloody fighting in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh on July 5-6.</p>
<p>The two had previously been co-premiers in a shaky coalition government.</p>
