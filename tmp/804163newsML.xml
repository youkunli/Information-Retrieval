<headline>N.Korea says opposition member from South defects.</headline>

<p>A prominent South Korean religious figure who is a member of the main opposition party has defected to North Korea, according to official North Korean media quoted on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Tokyo-based Radio Press news agency quoted the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) as saying Oh Ik-jae, the leader until 1995 of the 130-year old Chondokyo religious group, arrived in Pyongyang on Friday but did not say when he had defected from the South.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman for the main opposition National Congress for New Politics party, Park Sun-suck, said the party has not been able to confirm the report.</p>
<p>She stressed that although Oh still holds party membership, he no longer had a formal position in the party. She said he was an advisor to the party until May.</p>
<p>The party, whose leader has been accused by South Korea's ruling New Korea Party as being sympathetic towards the North, issued a statement demanding an immediate investigation by the government.</p>
<p>&quot;The party will also conduct an investigation, and if the report is true Oh will be expelled from the party,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was extremely shocking to hear the report of Oh Ik-jae's defection to the North and, if the report is true, it is very unfortunate and shameful to the Korean people.&quot;</p>
<p>Radio Press quoted KCNA as saying that Oh gave a speech on his arrival at Pyongyang's train station slamming South Korean President Kim Young-sam and praising the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not shirked from doing my best towards the peaceful reunification of the motherland by opposing this fascist presidency which is against reunification,&quot; he was quoted by KCNA as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to defect many years ago, but until now I could not fulfill this desire,&quot; Oh added.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the highest honour to come to this great society guided by Kim Jong-il...and I wish to uphold the principle of unification of the nation made clear by the great leader Kim Il-sung.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, 68, has also served on the Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification, a presidential advisory body. But an official at the advisory body said Oh's term as advisor ended in June.</p>
<p>South Korean nationals must have government permission to travel to communist North Korea. Travelling to Pyongyang without permission is forbidden.</p>
<p>A South Korean National Unification Ministry official said Oh had not sought permission to travel to the North.</p>
<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war. The U.S. has recently led fresh efforts to start formal talks on a permanent peace arrangement to replace the fraying armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean conflict.</p>
