<headline>SMH's Hayek says prospects point to growth.</headline>

<p>Nicolas Hayek, chairman of Ste Suisse Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie SA (SMH) said industry analysts had no reason to be nervous about the prospects for the Swiss watch maker, despite 1996 results which were below market expectations.</p>
<p>Hayek said in an interview with the Swiss financial bi-weekly Finanz und Wirtschaft that most analysts had forecast a 1996 group net profit of more than 300 million francs, above the actual result of 282 million.</p>
<p>But although SMH had raised its 1996 depreciation expenditure by 24 million francs from the 1995 level, cash flow had also risen, by 30 million francs.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason for analysts to be nervous,&quot; Hayek said. He added that the 1996 result did not indicate that SMH was veering from its growth path.</p>
<p>On Tuesday SMH reported a 3.3 percent rise in its group net profit to 282 million francs. Since then its shares have tumbled 9.2 percent on the Swiss Exchange.</p>
<p>Many analysts had forecast 1996 profit growth of 20 to 30 percent. In light of the result, many 1997 profit forecasts are being revised downward.</p>
<p>Societe Generale Bank &amp; Trust (SGBT), for example, has changed its recommendation for SMH shares to underperform from outperform and cut its earnings forecast for 1997 to 10.20 francs per share from a previous forecast of 12.60 francs.</p>
<p>Asked whether he was also was surprised about the result, Hayek said that towards the end of 1996 SMH had noticed that consumers in several European countries were very reluctant to spend.</p>
<p>Most of SMH's sales and profits come in the last 3-1/2 months of the year, Hayek said, noting this was a common trend for the past 12 years or more.</p>
<p>In addition SMH had &quot;significantly strengthened&quot; its investments in publicity and sales companies the Far East for 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p>The positive effects of this investment had already been seen during January and February, Hayek said.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember that we sell watches and not shares,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Finanz und Wirtschaft said that many analysts were critical of SMH's information policy and the company should have warned analysts in January that forecasts were too high.</p>
<p>However, Hayek told the paper that such a criticism was unfounded and showed a lack of understanding of the accounting procedures of international companies.</p>
<p>SMH consists of 350 profit centres worldwide, whose results have to be audited and aproved by boards, Hayek said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, I cannot have all analysts on my board and give them daily information,&quot; Hayek said.</p>
