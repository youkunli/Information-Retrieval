<p>Tajik rebels battling government forces vowed on Saturday to carry on fighting and denied a report that they were retreating towards the border with Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>&quot;We have consolidated our forces in an advantageous location in the mountain heights. We will fight to the bitter end. We would rather die fighting than disgrace ourselves,&quot; Lieutenant-Colonel Sergei Zavarygin told Reuters.</p>
<p>A government field commander said earlier that the rebels led by Colonel Makhmud Khudoyberdyev and his men were heading towards the Uzbek border.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not true that we are going to Afghanistan or to Uzbekistan...We do not want asylum there,&quot; said Zavaryugin, a deputy of Khudoyberdyev whose rebellion sparked fighting this week in the mountainous Central Asian state.</p>
<p>A Reuters correspondent travelling with Khudoberdyev's  entourage said his men were now about 160 km (100 miles) southwest of the capital Dushanbe.</p>
<p>The latest turmoil in Tajikistan came weeks after President Imomali Rakhmonov signed a peace agreement with Islamic opposition guerrillas aimed at ending four years of civil war in the impoverished former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>The Islamic guerrillas were not involved in the latest clashes but Khudoyberdyev joined the fray, moving his brigade towards Dushanbe a week ago.</p>
<p>He appeared to suffer some defeats in four days of fighting and Rakhmonov said on Wednesday that he had been dismissed.</p>
<p>Khudoyberdyev and his men refused to hand over their weapons, saying the government could not guarantee their safety, and moved out of their stronghold of Kurgan Tyube, 110 km (70 miles) south of Dushanbe.</p>
<p>A few government tanks, one flying a victorious red flag, drove around Kurgan Tyube on Saturday. Cars stayed off the street, shops were closed and people seemed afraid to leave their homes.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov as saying the Tajik authorities were gradually restoring order in the turbulent southwest.</p>
<p>But Saidov added that he was worried about the failure of Khudoyberdyev and his men to surrender their arms.</p>
<p>The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, met Rakhmonov in Dushanbe to discuss the peace accord between the government and the Islamic opposition, Itar-Tass news agency reported.</p>
