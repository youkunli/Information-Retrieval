<p>Argentine Marcelo Dominguez drew on his immense staying power to retain his World Boxing Council cruiserweight crown in a unanimous points decision against Frenchman Akim Tafer on Saturday.</p>
<p>The judges awarded the fight to Dominguez, who knocked out Tafer two years ago for the vacant title, with scores of 115-114, 117-112, 117-115.</p>
<p>Tafer, failing for the third time in an attempt to win the crown, had a considerable height and reach advantage over the Argentine but failed to press home his advantage when he held the upper hand in the early rounds.</p>
<p>He appeared to lose heart as the fight wore on and became frustrated when he was unable to put down the tough Argentine, making his fifth consecutive defence.</p>
<p>Dominguez, who has little style and often looks ungainly but is renowned for his courage, stayed in the battle despite taking a near perfect Tafer uppercut in the seventh.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Argentine was almost always the more ambitious of the fighters, looking constantly for ways beneath or round the Frenchman's defence.</p>
<p>Tafer, who turns 30 on August 27, was in tears after the decision, saying in the heat of the moment: &quot;Tonight in my head that's the end, I quit boxing.&quot;</p>
<p>He added: &quot;I'm going to rest for a fortnight or three weeks and I'll announce my decision. That was one of the hardest fights of my career.</p>
<p>&quot;I had my chance but I didn't manage to take it. I suffered a sudden fatigue in the sixth and seventh rounds and it's then that I must have lost the fight.</p>
<p>&quot;I finished stronger than him. I didn't think the verdict would be so severe. That's boxing. If the better man won, so be it.&quot;</p>
