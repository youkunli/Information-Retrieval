<title>RUSSIA: Tajik peace talks stall over military plans.</title>

<p>Talks between the Tajik government and its Islamist opponents have stalled over plans to integrate armed opposition units into the military structure, Interfax news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Moscow talks are trying to work out military arrangements to support a U.N.-sponsored peace accord signed last December after four years of fierce civil war in the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>Chief opposition negotiator Akbar Turazhonzoda told Interfax his side wanted its fighters to retain their battalion and company divisions within Tajikistan's armed forces.</p>
<p>The Moscow-backed government of President Imomali Rakhmonov, fearing the effective creation of an army within an army, wants the incorporated units to comprise only five to 10 men.</p>
<p>Russia, which has a large military force in the remote Central Asian republic of 5.7 million people, is mediating in the talks, which began last Wednesday.</p>
<p>A ceasefire has largely held since the December accord but Western observers say the two sides' inability to control armed bands who roam the mountainous state may jeopardise peace efforts.</p>
<p>Diplomats also say a power-sharing deal struck in Iran, sharing seats on a new commission for national reconciliation between the government and opposition, could be explosive because it left no places for any other faction.</p>
<p>It was not clear how long the talks in Moscow would last.</p>
