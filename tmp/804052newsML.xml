<headline>BASEBALL-DESHIELDS HOMERS IN 12TH AS CARDINALS NIP BRAVES.</headline>

<p>Delino DeShields was tired and he wanted to go home, so he homered leading off the bottom of the 12th inning to lift the St Louis Cardinals to a 3-2 victory over the slumping Atlanta Braves Friday.</p>
<p>DeShields greeted reliever Mike Cather (0-3) by hitting a 2-1 pitch over the right-field fence. &quot;I was very tired and I wanted to get back in,&quot; said DeShields.</p>
<p>&quot;I faked a bunt so he would throw a good fastball,&quot; he added. &quot;He got it up a little bit and I hit it.&quot;</p>
<p>The win was just the fourth in the last 17 games for the Cardinals, who erased a 2-0 deficit in the bottom of the ninth on a two-run homer by Mark McGwire.</p>
<p>Starter Tom Glavine took a two-hitter into the ninth but saw all his work ruined in a span of five pitches on a Ray Lankford single and McGwire's 2-1 blast to dead center.</p>
<p>Atlanta center fielder Kenny Lofton nearly hauled the ball in but it was just out of his reach. It was McGwire's fifth homer since being traded and his fourth in four games.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; admitted McGwire when asked if he thought he hit a homer. &quot;I've seen Lofton make too many catches and I didn't know it was out until I saw him hit his glove on his leg.&quot;</p>
<p>The Braves, who had a 133-game winning streak when leading after eight innings snapped Tuesday, lost for the second day in a row in that situation.</p>
<p>Curtis King, the sixth St Louis pitcher, allowed one hit in the 12th and picked up his first major-league win.</p>
<p>Atlanta, which has lost three straight, has been held to two runs or less in its last five games and dropped its fourth straight extra-inning game.</p>
<p>Michael Tucker had a two-run homer for Atlanta.</p>
<p>At Florida, Edgar Renteria's chopper with one out in the bottom of the ninth short-hopped second baseman Tony Womack and scored Gregg Zaun with the winning run as the Marlins rallied to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-5.</p>
<p>The Marlins, who entered the ninth down by a run, won for the 18th time this year in their final at-bat, this time against closer Rich Loiselle (1-3).</p>
<p>Jay Powell (4-2) got the final out in the ninth to notch the victory for Florida, which has won eight of its last 12 and is just 3 1/2 games behind Atlanta in the National League Eastern Division.</p>
<p>In Denver, Frank Castillo pitched seven strong innings and Vinny Castilla and Larry Walker hit two-run homers to power the Colorado Rockies to 6-2 victory over the New York Mets.</p>
<p>Castillo (9-10) gave up two runs with a walk and a pair of strikeouts. Rookie Todd Helton had three hits for the Rockies.</p>
<p>Rick Reed (10-6) lost his second straight after a four-game winning streak. The right-hander surrendered three runs -- two earned -- and eight hits over six innings.</p>
<p>Edgardo Alfonzo went 3-for-4 with an RBI double for New York, which fell 3 1/2 games behind Florida in the National League wild-card race.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Mike Remlinger allowed three runs over six innings and helped his own cause with a three-run double to lead the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-3 victory, his second win against the Dodgers in five days.</p>
<p>Remlinger (6-4), who has won all four of his starts this season, gave up six hits with four walks and six strikeouts. As a batter, he entered the game with one hit and one RBI in 38 career at-bats and was 0-for-7 this season.</p>
<p>Before the game, the Dodgers retired the number 2 worn by former manager Tommy Lasorda, who was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on August 3.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, former Expo Kirk Rueter helped himself with two hits and two RBI, leading the Giants to a 6-2 over the Montreal Expos, who lost their fourth straight.</p>
<p>Rueter (9-5) gave up one run and six hits with a walk and five strikeouts in seven innings, beating his former team for the first time in three starts this season. The left-hander has hits in his last three games.</p>
<p>Julian Tavarez worked the last two innings and gave up a solo homer to Chris Widger, but San Francisco held on for its ninth win in 13 games.</p>
<p>Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent hit solo homers for the Giants, who lead the Dodgers by 2 1/2 in the N.L. West.</p>
<p>In Houston, Rico Brogna had his second two-homer game of the season, both of them against the Astros, and Curt Schilling improved to 3-0 against Houston as the Philadelphia Phillies won their season-high fifth straight victory, 5-1.</p>
<p>Schilling (13-10) allowed one run and five hits over eight innings and struck out 10 for his 13th double-digit strikeout effort of the season. He has a 1.57 ERA against Houston, including a 2-0 mark with a 1.20 ERA at the Astrodome.</p>
<p>In San Diego, Sterling Hitchcock (8-7) tossed a four-hitter for his first complete game in nearly two years and Quilvio Veras broke out of a 5-for-43 slump to go 3-for-3 and score twice as the Padres beat the Chicago Cubs 5-1.</p>
<p>Ken Caminiti added two hits, including a solo homer, for San Diego, which has won five of seven after losing eight of 10 games.</p>
