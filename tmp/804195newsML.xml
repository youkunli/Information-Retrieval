<p>Jordan's official share index fell slightly on Saturday but foreign-inspired orders on cement along with local portfolio interest in select blue-chip held back the bourse from further slides, brokers said.</p>
<p>The official 60-share Amman Financial Market (AFM) index shed 0.38 percent to 164.57 points in an otherwise healthy turnover worth 1.2 million dinars ($1.7 million).</p>
<p>Jordan Phosphate Mines shed 0.01 dinars to 3.96 dinars in Saturday's busiest traded stock worth 202,226 dinars. Jordan Cement Factory shares were unchanged at 4.00 dinars in mooderate trade worth 172,437 dinars.</p>
<p>Brokers said they detected mainly foreign inspired orders executed on their behalf by local brokers on the two blue-chip stock, known to be traditional favourites with global funds.</p>
<p>The market also saw active local portfolio trade on Jordan Petroleum Refinery after reports it resolved a longstanding financial dispute with the government, to gain a sharp 0.09 dinars to 10.07 dinars.</p>
<p>A total of 11,528 shares of JOPT were traded valued at 116,112 dinars.</p>
<p>&quot;There was balanced buying and selling with no strong demand emerging nor any large selling offers which kept prices generally steady,&quot; said Ibrahim Odeh, broker at Wataniyeh Financial Services.</p>
<p>Odeh said the bourse also detected growing demand on some shares of firms which have already announced healthy half year earnings.</p>
<p>Overall gains outnumbered falling stock. Overall 19 shares rose and 12 fell, with another 14 trading but closing unchanged.</p>
<p>In banks, Jordan Kuwait Bank saw some local orders, rising 0.02 dinars to 3.05 dinars in transactions worth 173,383 dinars.</p>
<p>Irbid Electricity, Jordan's second largest electricity distribution firm, rose again to the maximum daily five percent limit, gaining 0.08 dinars to 1.62 dinars.</p>
<p>Interest in the rarely traded utility firm was sparked by an announcement last week by the government, a major shareholder in the firm, that it was looking for investors to link up with a local partner to buy up 51 percent of the company.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 best-performing shares in terms of turnover and financial performance, fixed at 100 points at the end of 1994, rose 0.03 percent to 80.59 points, 3.364 percent down since the start of the year. $1= 0.709 dinars</p>
