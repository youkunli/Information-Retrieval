<p>A weapon scare forced the evacuation of about 1,000 travelers on Saturday at the San Jose International Airport, delaying at least 20 flights for hours, airport officials said.</p>
<p>The evacuation was ordered after airport security reported what looked like a handgun in a backpack, airport spokeswoman Rosemary O'Kane said.</p>
<p>Flights at the San Jose airport, located about 40 miles (64 km) south of San Francisco, were put on hold for nearly three hours as airport security searched for the weapon.</p>
<p>After searching the airport and interviewing passengers, security determined that the alleged handgun was in fact a toy that was packed in a young boy's carry-on backpack.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unfortunate that the incident occurred,&quot; O'Kane said. &quot;But customer safety is our first concern.&quot;</p>
<p>The incident delayed at least 20 flights, interfering with the travel plans of an estimated 4,000 passengers.</p>
