<p>President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov will meet on Monday in a bid to improve their frayed ties but the two sides remain far apart on the thorny issue of Chechnya's status.</p>
<p>The secretary of Russia's Security Council Ivan Rybkin said on Saturday the delayed meeting between Yeltsin and Maskhadov would take place in the Kremlin at midday (0800 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparations for the meeting are going ahead smoothly,&quot; Itar-Tass news agency quoted Rybkin as saying after talks with Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov in Moscow.</p>
<p>Udugov also sounded a positive note. &quot;There is enough political will on both sides to ensure that this meeting will have results,&quot; he said in televised comments.</p>
<p>But in the Chechen capital Grozny on Saturday Maskhadov made clear he would not be backing off from his demand that Moscow recognise his tiny breakaway region as a sovereign state.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has come to define our relations and to conclude an all-embracing treaty with the establishment of diplomatic relations,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, who led Chechen separatists in their 21-month-long bloody conflict with Russian troops that ended last August, insists that his republic is already independent.</p>
<p>The Kremlin says Chechnya must stay within the Russian Federation, although with wide autonomy.</p>
<p>Maskhadov was clearly frustrated by the lack of progress his republic has made since a peace pact was signed last August. That pact postponed for five years a final decision on Chechnya's status.</p>
<p>&quot;They (Russia and the international community) do not want us Chechens to create our own state and show the world our ability to live independently,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>No country has recognised Chechnya as an independent state.</p>
<p>Tensions between Moscow and Chechnya have risen again in recent days after Udugov accused Russian fighter planes of simulating an attack on Grozny's airport and central market.</p>
<p>Russia's military denied the allegation.</p>
<p>Yeltsin and Maskhadov are expected to discuss ways of reviving Chechnya's shattered economy, which is heavily dependent on an oil pipeline that runs across its territory from Azerbaijan to Russia's Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Rybkin as saying on Saturday that the first oil would start flowing through the pipeline in the near future.</p>
<p>The two sides have been at loggerheads over the amount of money Chechnya should earn in transit fees.</p>
<p>The Chechens have accused Moscow of imposing an economic blockade on their republic but Rybkin dismissed such talk.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a lie,&quot; he said in televised remarks, adding that Moscow had ploughed 847 billion roubles ($148.6 million) into Chechnya so far this year.</p>
<p>On Friday the Kremlin said Yeltsin would put pressure on Maskhadov during their meeting to do more to help free Russian journalists and other hostages held in Chechnya.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, battling a wave of lawlessness since being elected president in January, has said hostage takers will face the death penalty or tough prison sentences.</p>
<p>On Saturday Tass said Chechen security forces had freed one hostage on Friday but did not reveal the person's identity. The kidnappers had been seeking a half million dollar ransom. A Chechen policeman was killed in the operation, it said.</p>
<p>Two Britons, five French people, a German, a Slovak and a Yugoslav are among the people currently missing in Chechnya.</p>
