<headline>African ministers say might bypass sanctions on Libya.</headline>
<dateline>TRIPOLI 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>African foreign ministers urged the U.N. Security Council to accept a compromise with Libya in the Lockerbie affair and said the African Summit to be held next June would look at ways to bypass sanctions imposed on Tripoli in 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council (of African ministers) strongly recommend that the Security Council consider the ways and means for a rapid resolution of the crisis,&quot; they said in a declaration adopted at the end of a three-day annual conference in Tripoli on Friday night.</p>
<p>&quot;(The) Council wishes to reiterate its position expressed at its 64th ordinary session in Yaouande from 1-6 July 1996 to the effect that continued imposition of sanctions might lead African countries to devise other means of sparing the Libyan people future suffering,&quot; they said.</p>
<p>&quot;In this respect, the Council mandates the Secretary-General of the OAU to prepare a practical plan of action to be considered for implementation&quot; at the next OAU ummit in Harare, Zimbabwe, next June, they added.</p>
<p>Sanctions on Libya, including a ban on international flights that forced representatives of 52 African countries to travel by road to the OAU conference, have been in effect since Tripoli failed in 1992 to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of an airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.</p>
<p>Washington and London want the two men tried in the United States or Britain and rejected a proposal accepted by Libya that the two be tried in a neutral country by Scottish magistrates and under Scottish law.</p>
<p>The African Council said it &quot;strongly deplores the fact that the three concerned Western countries have so far shown indifference to the initiatives presented to them with view to a just and equitable solution to the crisis&quot;.</p>
<p>It proposed to the Security Council three options for a solution:</p>
<p>- hold the trial of the two suspects in a third and neutral country to be determined by the Security Council;</p>
<p>- have the two suspects tried by Scottish judges at the Internationl Court of Justice (ICJ) at the Hague in accordance with Scottish law;</p>
<p>- establish a special criminal tribunal at the ICJ to try the two suspects.</p>
<p>Th OAU meeting in Tripoli was described by OAU officials as a show of solidarity with Libya.</p>
