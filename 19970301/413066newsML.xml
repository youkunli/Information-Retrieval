<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said in an interview published on Saturday that he had set up a special team to track Middle East peace developments, with an eye to giving Paris a higher profile in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked Jean-Claude Cousseran, director for North Africa and the Middle East at the Foreign Ministry to give a special priority to the Middle East,&quot; de Charette told the French daily Le Monde.</p>
<p>&quot;He has set up a team specifically responsible for following the day-to-day situation in the Middle East and coming up with proposals for a more active role for France in the Middle East,&quot; the minister said.</p>
<p>De Charette is visiting Israel, Syria and Lebanon during a three-day trip to the region beginning on Tuesday.</p>
<p>France has been pressing for months for a higher profile for itself and its European partners in Middle East diplomacy, now dominated by the United States.</p>
<p>While the European Union has agreed to underwrite much of the cost of the peace process, Washington has led negotiations for a political deal.</p>
<p>But Israel distrusts France, which has more openly courted the region's Arab powers.</p>
<p>Israel last week lodged an official complaint after Paris disclosed that de Charette would spend just 24 hours in the Jewish state. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Ygal Palmor said Paris had originally planned &quot;a full state visit of two or three days&quot;.</p>
