<p>A prosecutor has asked an Iranian court to pass death sentences against three state officials being tried on charges of economic sabotage and taking bribes, a newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The daily Kayhan said the prosecutor urged the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran to convict the three senior customs officials as &quot;corrupters on earth&quot;. Such a conviction under Moslem sharia law usually carries a death sentence.</p>
<p>The three are charged with having received up to 12 billion rials ($4 million) each to falsify documents allowing exporters to take valuable Persian carpets out of the country as inexpensive rugs.</p>
<p>They are also accused of causing disruptions in the economy through contacts with &quot;Zionist elements abroad&quot; and hurting carpet exports, Iran's second source of hard cash after oil.</p>
<p>The case follows a series of trials for embezzlement and fraud at state agencies which have featured prominently in the press and sparked a wide public outcry.</p>
<p>Iran's Islamic leaders have reacted to reports of corruption by demanding tougher action by courts and watchdog bodies.</p>
<p>Death sentences for economic crimes have been rare in Iran in the past few years. Tehran in January executed two Iranian businessmen convicted of economic sabotage and spying for Israel and the United States.</p>
<p>In the biggest fraud case in Iran's history, a businessman was executed in 1995 for defrauding a state bank of $21.7 million. ($1=3,000 rials at the official exchange rate)</p>
