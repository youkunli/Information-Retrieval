<title>CHINA: China's Li vows tough stance on ethnic unrest.</title>
<headline>China's Li vows tough stance on ethnic unrest.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1997-03-01</dateline>

<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng vowed on Saturday to take a tough line on ethnic unrest, one of Beijing's chief security fears as it fights to keep restive Moslems and Tibetans under control in its vast border regions.</p>
<p>Li's pledge, in his annual speech to parliament, came a day after Chinese police reported several arrests following time-bomb attacks on buses in the Moslem-dominated far-west region of Xinjiang that killed four people and wounded more than 60.</p>
<p>Li's speech did not mention Tuesday's attacks, which have not been reported by China's state-controlled media.</p>
<p>But he said his government would &quot;unswervingly safeguard the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, and resolutely oppose any words or activities designed to split the country or damage ethnic unity.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuesday's blasts in Urumqi, the centre of Chinese control over Xinjiang and its ethnic Uighur population, were the latest examples of brewing unrest in the vast, oil-rich region bordering Central Asia.</p>
<p>Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Urumqi officials believe they were planned by Uighur separatists who have mounted a campaign for an independent &quot;East Turkestan&quot; in the region.</p>
<p>China also faces sporadic outbursts of unrest in Tibet, which has been under tight security since 1959 when troops put down an anti-Chinese uprising and the region's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled into exile.</p>
<p>Li said it was important that China &quot;consolidate and develop&quot; ethnic unity, which he said was already improving.</p>
<p>&quot;We should value and further develop this good situation,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said China was committed to respecting religious freedom and to &quot;helping various religions to adapt themselves to socialist society&quot;.</p>
