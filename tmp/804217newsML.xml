<p>President Bill Clinton told parents on Saturday that they should begin preparing their children for college as early as the sixth grade.</p>
<p>In his weekly radio address, Clinton also highlighted a series of items in the balanced budget legislation designed to make it easier for families to afford higher education.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents can't wait to plan for college until their children are in their junior or senior years of high school,&quot; Clinton said in a text of the address.</p>
<p>&quot;It's essential that parents sit down with their kids as early as the sixth grade to start charting a course toward college,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Clinton also said the years of sixth, seventh and eighth grades are crucial for children to begin taking challenging courses to prepare them for higher education.</p>
<p>The Education Department has written a guide called &quot;Getting Ready for College Early&quot; for parents that can be ordered for free by calling 1-800-USA-LEARN, he added.</p>
<p>The president also singled out four items in the budget pact, which he signed into law on Aug. 5 and which aims to balance the budget by 2002, designed to help ordinary Americans afford college. These include:</p>
<p>-- the &quot;Hope Scholarship&quot; tax credit of up to $1,500 to help pay for the first two years of college;</p>
<p>-- &quot;Lifetime Learning Credits&quot; that offer people a tax credit of up to 20 percent on the first $5,000 of tuition; this is designed to fund the third and fourth years of college as well as graduate school and continuing education for adults and the credit rises to 20 percent of up to $10,000 in 2003;</p>
<p>-- permitting parents and grandparents to withdraw money from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) without any penalty to pay for higher education; parents and grandparents can also invest $500 per child per year in new education IRAS to build up money for college tax-free;</p>
<p>-- and the budget agreement provides 350,000 more Pell Grant scholarships for higher education.</p>
<p>In the Republican response, Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson said education reform that makes it easier for people who are not wealthy to send children to private schools was the most important issue facing Americans.</p>
<p>&quot;What are Democrats so afraid of when it comes to choice, competition, and accountability in our schools?&quot; Carlson asked. &quot;Democratic answers include a few more national tests, a few more summits and a truckload of tax dollars which will not solve the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's put the needs of children and parents first and give them the choices they need for success,&quot; he added. &quot;Competition promotes quality and we believe our schools and our children need it.&quot;</p>
