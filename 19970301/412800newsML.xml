<p>Sudan has welcomed a United Nations report on the humanitarian impact of a proposed air embargo on the country for its failure to extradite three men accused of trying to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>The government daily Al-Sudan Al-Hadith on Saturday quoted Abdel Aziz Shido, deputy speaker of Sudan's parliament, as describing the report as &quot;positive and fair&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope the Security Council will respond to the report... on the negative humanitarian effects and the dangers which implementation of the resolution would have,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sudan has been under diplomatic sanctions and its senior officials subject to a foreign travel ban since last May. It was accused of failing to extradite three men accused of trying to assassinate Mubarak during a visit to Addis Ababa in June 1995.</p>
<p>Sudan said it has found no trace of the wanted men.</p>
<p>U.N. Under-Secretary-General Yasushi Akashi, who heads the department of humanitarian affairs, briefed the Security Council members on the report setting out the potential humanitarian impact of an aviation embargo.</p>
<p>The report, circulated among council members, says an air ban could affect food production, patients seeking treatment abroad and the distribution of medicines, but should not hamper food aid to Sudan, where a civil war has long been raging.</p>
<p>Shido called on the Security Council members to show that they are independent and not succumb to U.S. pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;Will the council continue to respond to U.S. pressure after the...report or will it deal with it with justice?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Security Council last August voted in principle to add a ban on flights abroad by Sudanese aircrafts but postponed setting a date for putting it into effect.</p>
<p>Shido said the case against Sudan is a political issue and that Sudan Airways has nothing to do with it.</p>
