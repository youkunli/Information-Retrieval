<p>President Ernesto Samper deplored the U.S. decision to keep Colombia on a drugs blacklist on Friday calling it &quot;profoundly unjust&quot; and &quot;demoralizing&quot; for everyone involved in the country's anti-drug fight.</p>
<p>Samper and his foreign minister both reacted to the decision by threatening to revise all bilateral cooperation agreements with Washington and move quickly to identify new allies in the country's drug fight.</p>
<p>&quot;All our programmes of joint cooperation, especially those regarding (drug) crop eradication, will be revamped,&quot; Samper said. &quot;We will look for new allies in our fight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must revise all cooperation agreements,&quot; added Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia. &quot;Our commmitments are not with the United States but with ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>She referred to the European Union -- particularly Britain, Spain and France -- and Mexico and other Andean nations as countries with which Colombia would seek to forge closer ties and cooperation.</p>
<p>Samper, who spoke in an address after decorating a large group of police and military officials for outstanding efforts on the frontlines of the drug war, also rejected U.S. charges of corruption at the &quot;highest levels&quot; of his government.</p>
<p>The charges had been reiterated earlier by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as among the reasons that Colombia had been &quot;decertified&quot; for a second consecutive year as a trusthworthy ally in the fight against narcotics.</p>
<p>The United States accused Samper of taking millions of dollars in drug money toi finance his 1994 election campaign.</p>
<p>Colombia's Congress absolved Samper last year, three months after the country was decertified for the first time, of any wrongdoing in connection with his campaign. But U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey told Colombian reporters in Washington Thursday that U.S. officials felt &quot;continuing insecurity about President Samper and some of his accused officials.&quot;</p>
<p>Samper said U.S. officials had consistently &quot;thrown a shadow of doubt over the honesty&quot; of his government. But he said the annual drug certification process should be used to evaluate objective anti-drug efforts on the ground instead of &quot;to judge governments, replace judges and disqualify democracies.&quot;</p>
<p>In a thinly-veiled reference to Mexico, which was certified as a worthy ally against drug trafficking, Samper said the entire certification process had become &quot;an unacceptable instrument of political discrimination&quot; since it failed to take into account real progress in the drug war and handed out &quot;rewards or punishment for strictly political reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is unjust because it legitimises the intent of some to use certification as a weapon in trade wars,&quot; said Samper who peppered his speech with repeated uses of the word &quot;unjust&quot; and &quot;demoralizing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Colombia,&quot; he added, &quot;has been made into a scapegoat to free others of blame.&quot;</p>
<p>Mexico has been rocked by numerous drug corruption scandals over the past year but many Colombians had expected it to be certified because of its growing importance to the United States under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear how seriously U.S.-Colombian relations would suffer because of the U.S. move, and Washington has refrained from imposing painful economic sanctions on Colombia so far. But Vice President Carlos Lemos Simmonds said ties between the world's biggest drug producer, and its biggest consumer of illegal drugs, were headed for a new low.</p>
<p>&quot;Entire decades of friendship, alliance and cooperation have been wiped out by a procedure lacking in any credibility,&quot; he said.</p>
