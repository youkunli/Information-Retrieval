<p>Rangers lead at the top of the Scottish premier division was cut to five points on Saturday when they drew 2-2 at Aberdeen and their only title challengers Celtic beat Hearts 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>The results leave Rangers -- seeking to emulate Celtic's record run of nine successive championships in the 1960s and 1970s -- on 68 points from 28 matches with Celtic on 63, also from 28. Dundee United are a distant third with 49 points.</p>
<p>Rangers went ahead at Aberdeen through Dane Michael Laudrup after only five minutes, but the home side pulled level through Antoine Kombouare after 35 minutes.</p>
<p>Aberdeen then went ahead after 57 minutes though an Andy Goram own goal when he dropped the ball over his own line at a high cross which carried in the wind. Craig Moore won Rangers a share of the points with a headed equaliser after 63 minutes, his first goal of the season.</p>
<p>Portuguese striker Jorge Cadete opened the scoring for Celtic at home to Hearts with Italian Paolo di Canio making it 2-0 in the second half.</p>
<p>The top teams in Scotland now have only eight league games to play with a possible title decider coming up on March 16 when Celtic play Rangers at Parkhead.</p>
