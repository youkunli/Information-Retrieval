<headline>German SPD's Scharping seeks tax on millionaires.</headline>
<dateline>BONN 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The parliamentary leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD), Rudolf Scharping, proposed a special tax on millionaires requiring them to pay one to three percent of their wealth to the taxman each year.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be a kind of solidarity surcharge for millionaires which will generate 45 to 50 billion marks per year for the state,&quot; Scharping was quoted as telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper.</p>
<p>The money would go towards funding the welfare system, promoting job creation, financing state aid for east Germany and easing the burden on other taxpayers, Scharping said.</p>
<p>Germans already pay a so-called solidarity income tax surcharge of 7.5 percent to help fund east German development.</p>
<p>Scharping said the tax should be introduced either on January 1, 1998 as part of the package of tax reforms now being discussed with the ruling coalition parties or after the 1998 general election, &quot;when we will have the majority.&quot;</p>
<p>Bild am Sonntag made the article available ahead of publication in Sunday's edition.</p>
<p>The tax was not intended to punish the rich but rather as way for them to show solidarity at a difficult time for the state's finances, Scharping said. An SPD working group would work out details for the proposal by Easter.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to at least reach the American level (of tax), but not as high as in Britain or Canada. It is not intended as a punitive action, but as an action of solidarity.&quot;</p>
<p>The tax could amount to one percent on a wealth of one million marks upwards, two percent from 10 millon marks and three percent from 50 million marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole thing will have to be introduced with a (backdated) start date so that people don't just suddenly take their money and run. I would like to have January 1, 1997 as the retroactive start date.&quot;</p>
<p>Bild am Sonntag said the SPD estimates that 950,000 private households in Germany have net wealth of one million marks or higher.</p>
