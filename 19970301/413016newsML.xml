<p>Fifty-three mushers, including old-timers who competed in the first inaugural race in 1973, departed Anchorage on Saturday to start the 25th Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.</p>
<p>First out of the starting chute was Joe Redington, the 80-year-old founder of the grueling race, who led the Iditarod's ceremonial 20-mile (36 km) run to Eagle River.</p>
<p>Some of the loudest cheers were for top woman racer DeeDee Jonrowe, who is competing despite major injuries suffered in an auto wreck this winter.</p>
<p>She hugged her mother, Peggy Stout, before stepping on her sled for the first leg of the 1,150-mile (1,850 km) race to Nome.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't help but be concerned, because I'm a mother. Mothers are always concerned,&quot; Stout said of her daughter's injuries. &quot;She won't overstep her bounds -- at least that's what she promises.&quot;</p>
<p>Others competing for a share of the purse in excess of $400,000, include two-time winner Jeff King, two-time winner Martin Buser, 1995 winner Doug Swingley and perennial contenders Tim Osmar, Charlie Boulding and Bill Cotter.</p>
<p>Last to depart was veteran Ken Chase who took part in the first Iditarod in 1973. Asked how this year's race compared with the first Iditarod, he said laughing: &quot;Lots of rules and lots of support. Lots of interest.&quot;</p>
<p>The first Iditarod started with little fanfare, without the crowds, colourful uniforms or the rock music that blared on Saturday from speakers at the starting line, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we have to do all this stuff, propaganda -- well, advertising, I guess,&quot; he said. &quot;It's nice for the public, but it's hard for the dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>Although Alaska Natives dominated many of the early races, Chase, a 55-year-old Athabaskan Indian from the Yukon River village of Anvik, was one of only four Natives who started this year's Iditarod.</p>
<p>Emmitt Peters, an Athabaskan from the Yukon River village of Ruby who won the 1975 Iditarod, said the big financial investment now needed to take part in the race was a major factor inhibiting Alaska Natives from taking part.</p>
<p>In 1975, he said, he spent $3,500 on the race. Now it took at least $25,000 to $30,000 to put together a competitive team and people in Native villages did not have access to lucrative sponsorships, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;You either have to live in Anchorage or Fairbanks to get a shot at it,&quot; Peters said.</p>
<p>The race clock and real competition will start on Sunday, when mushers begin their wilderness journey from the nearby town of Willow -- a slight variation from the normal route forced by an early thaw.</p>
<p>Last year, King won the race in nine days, five hours and 43 minutes, 13 seconds. Swingley holds the record of nine days, two hours, 42 minutes and 19 seconds.</p>
