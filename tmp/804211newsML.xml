<headline>Turkish military limit on Aegean activity expires.</headline>

<p>Turkey's temporary limit on military activity in the Aegean Sea, designed to support NATO-led efforts to reduce tension between Greece and Turkey, expired on Saturday, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>The Turkish military announced on July 1 that the navy and air force would restrict activities in the region to routine training and reconnaissance as part of &quot;confidence building measures&quot; until August 15.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli said the measure had been fully observed during the period and would now come to an end. Anatolian quoted him as saying Greece had not contributed to such measures.</p>
<p>Turkey regularly carries out war games in the Aegean in the summer, but vowed that Turkish aircraft would not be armed when operating in the region during the period.</p>
<p>NATO members Turkey and Greece came close to conflict in January 1996 over a deserted islet in the Aegean. They are also at odds over the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus.</p>
<p>In July the historical rivals agreed a set of principles designed to improve their relations, including a commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means.</p>
