<p>Finance ministers of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) pledged on Saturday to step up cooperation in finance, banking, customs and insurance.</p>
<p>The move was essential to achieve the target of creating a regional free trade area by 2003, the ministers said in a communique at the end of a one-day meeting.</p>
<p>The communique said the promotion of sound and efficient practices among commercial banks in ASEAN would be given priority to help them meet the challenges produced by globalisation of financial markets.</p>
<p>Malaysian Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the statement did not contradict another announcement by the ASEAN finance heads that the seven-member group was committed to the efforts of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to liberalise financial services.</p>
<p>&quot;While we support as a principle the liberalisation and deregulatiion process, we of course have to view our own strategies and use a forum like this to devise a common strategy and programme according to our set of priorities,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it's anyway contradictory to our firm commitment...I don't want to dwell in a long debate but we have seen so much contradiction even among the more industrialised powers and therefore we resent any notion of attempting to subvert any sort of agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Malaysia with Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Thai officials said the meeting boosted ASEAN's unity ahead of scheduled talks with European Union finance ministers in Bangkok in September.</p>
<p>The meeting agreed ASEAN members would promote more cross listing of companies on stock exchanges within the group, whose bullish economies grew by an average of 6.5 percent last year.</p>
<p>But Singapore and Thai officials said ASEAN members would need more time to standardise accounting and legal settlement practices, as well as rules on public disclosure of corporate performance.</p>
<p>A more tangible outcome of the meeting was the signing of an ASEAN Agreement on Customs which called for greater harmonisation of customs procedures, product classification, and tariff assessment practices.</p>
<p>It also sought to increase cooperation in promoting insurance business and avoiding double taxation.</p>
