<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin stepped up pressure on his government on Saturday before an expected cabinet reshuffle by ordering it to pay salaries on time to reduce social tensions.</p>
<p>The order, issued by decree, was the 66-year-old president's latest signal that he is back in charge and means business after spending most of the last eight months out of the Kremlin with health problems.</p>
<p>It was also a further sign of Yeltsin's dissatisfaction with his government although he offered no clues about the cabinet reshuffle expected in the next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government of the Russian Federation shall ensure the unconditional allocation each month to subjects of the Russian Federation money...on the terms set by the Federal Law on the 1997 Federal Budget,&quot; the decree said.</p>
<p>The text of the decree said the aim was to &quot;ensure the constitutional right of citizens to be paid for work and its timely payment and to reduce social tensions&quot;.</p>
<p>The decree partly represented an attempt by Yeltsin to shift the blame for a huge backlog of wages in the state sector which has prompted widespread protests, and to show that he is ready to get tough to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>Some teachers, miners and other workers have not been paid for months and trade unions are threatening a day of nationwide protests on March 27. Yeltsin's politicial foes have used the wage problem as ammunition in efforts to oust him.</p>
<p>Yeltsin criticised the 1997 budget on Friday, just three days after approving it, and vowed to play a bigger role in mapping out the 1998 budget. But he said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had pledged to &quot;meet promises to pay people&quot;.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin says the wage delays are caused by a shortfall in revenue due to tax dodging, but he agreed to recommend some government changes to Yeltsin after the president criticised his social policy last Monday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's criticism prompted speculation that Chernomyrdin will be replaced, but many newspapers suggest the president has little to gain by firing his loyal ally and see various motives behind his attacks on the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The president is trying at least partially to shift responsibility for this year's budget policy,&quot; the independent Kommersant Daily newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Dismissing Yeltsin's pledge to play a bigger personal role in next year's budget as populist move, it said: &quot;In this case, Boris Yeltsin's promise should be regarded more as self-promotion than a factor of economic policy.&quot;</p>
<p>Other ministers who Russian media say have cause for concern include Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and most of those whose responsibilities include the economy or the social sphere.</p>
<p>Yetsin's speech next Thursday, expected to last up to 40 minutes, will be a test of his health and strength following heart surgery last November and pneumonia in January.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Yeltsin would announce in the speech that he and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko had agreed in principle to hold simultaneous national referendums on closer integration between their countries.</p>
<p>Yeltsin raised the idea of the referendums in a letter to Lukashenko last January and the Belarus leader welcomed it.</p>
<p>The Kremlin leader is thought to have the support of millions of Russians in seeking re-integration with heir small western neighbour of about 10 million people.</p>
