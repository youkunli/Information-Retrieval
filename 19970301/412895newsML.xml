<headline>Mexico held drug lord for a day before announcement.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-02-28</dateline>

<p>Mexican police detained drugs kingpin Oscar Malherbe de Leon and held him for more than 24 hours before making a dramatic announcement just ahead of Washington's decision on Friday to &quot;certify&quot; Mexico's anti-narcotics efforts, authorities said.</p>
<p>The Attorney General's Office said in a statement released on Friday that Malherbe, the head of the Gulf or Matamoros drugs cartel, &quot;was arrested in the afternoon of Wednesday the 26th of this month near a commercial centre in the (Mexico City) area of Mixcoac.&quot;</p>
<p>In its initial announcement of the arrest just before midnight on Thursday, authorities did not say when or where he had been held.</p>
<p>U.S. officials praised the arrest early on Friday and within hours, U.S. President Bill Clinton certified that Mexico is an ally in the drug war, despite strong opposition from critics of Mexican drug corruption.</p>
<p>Clinton &quot;decided to grant Mexico a full certification but with firm expectations of further (anti-drugs) progress in the near term,&quot; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in announcing certification decisions for 32 countries.</p>
<p>The Mexican Attorney General's Office said Malherbe was arrested in an operation begun last May.</p>
<p>&quot;During Monday and Tuesday this week the operation intensified when his presence was observed in Mexico City, where he was visiting a relative who is hospitalized, according to his statements to investigators,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;As of early this morning, Oscar Malherbe de Leon is being held at the (high-security) Almoloya de Juarez prison&quot; near Mexico City, it added.</p>
