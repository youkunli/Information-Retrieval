<headline>Dominican-Haiti border tense amid deportation flap.</headline>
<dateline>SANTO DOMINGO 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dominican officials on Saturday described the mood at the Dominican Republic-Haiti border as a tense calm, a day after at least three people were shot and wounded in a clash over Dominican deportations of Haitian nationals.</p>
<p>On Friday at least three Haitians were wounded, one of them seriously, when Haitian border police dispersed a protest in the Haitian border town of Juana Mendez over the partial closure of the border with the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the Caribbean island Hispaniola.</p>
<p>Jose Montas, the Dominican counsul in Juana Mendez, told Reuters in a telephone interview there had been no more incidents by Saturday morning but that the situation was tense.</p>
<p>Haitians typically cross the border near Juana Mendez without visas on Fridays, travelling to markets in Dajabon, on the Dominican side of the border.</p>
<p>But Haitian and Dominican officials, who have been trading accusations over deportation in recent months of at least 15,000 people of Haitian descent from the Dominican Republic, on Friday suddenly began demanding passports and visas.</p>
<p>The angry Haitian demonstrators set fire to an immigration office, prompting Dominican authorities to send soldiers to reinforce the frontier.</p>
<p>The boy who was seriously wounded was taken to a hospital in Santiago and operated on. He was in stable condition early Saturday morning.</p>
