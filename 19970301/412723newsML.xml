<p>World number one Pete Sampras, the last remaining seed at the Advanta Championships, outclassed qualifer Doug Flach 6-4 6-2 on Friday to roll into the semifinals.</p>
<p>Samras, who won the Australian Open and San Jose tournament earlier this year, extended his unbeaten record in 1997 to 15-0 with Friday's victory.</p>
<p>&quot;He's just a level above everybody else,&quot; said the 129th-ranked Flach, who had no answer for Sampras's arsenal of shots.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, he's two levels above me,&quot; joked Flach. &quot;My strategy? Not to get hit by a serve.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing between Sampras and his third consecutive final this year is 88th-ranked Dutchman Sjeng Shalken, another qualifier, who had little trouble disposing of 61st-ranked American Jonathan Stark 6-2 6-4 in their quarter-final.</p>
<p>Saturday's other semifinal pits 78th-ranked Grant Stafford of South Africa against 60th-ranked Australian Patrick Rafter.</p>
<p>Stafford, who upset second-seeded defending champion Jim Courier Thursday, did away with 66th-ranked Sandon Stolle of Australia 6-4 6-2.</p>
<p>Rafter recovered from a bad second set to oust 55th-ranked Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-3 1-6 6-1.</p>
<p>Sampras, who struggled with his serve before beating Swede Jonas Bjorkman Thursday night, enjoyed a far more efficient performance against Flach.</p>
<p>&quot;This was the best match I've played so far this week. I really didn't let him get into the match,&quot; said Sampras, who belted nine aces and won 81 percent of his first-serve points.</p>
<p>Sampras, who lost his serve four time in the previous round, never faced a break point against Flach.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Schalken, the youngest player to win a title last year, took just five games from Sampras in their only previous meeting last year at the Lipton Championships.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to try and win more than five games,&quot; Schalken said his semifinal aspirations. &quot;I think it will be different this time. He has to play good, otherwise I beat him.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel good, strong,&quot; Schalken said. &quot;It's been an amazing week.&quot;</p>
