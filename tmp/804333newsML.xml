<p>Indonesia's President Suharto said on Saturday the country's tight monetary and fiscal policies would continue in the wake of the upheavals in its rupiah currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies will be maintained until the market situation is calm again and the exchange rate becomes relatively stable at a new level of equilibrium,&quot; he said during a state-of-the-nation address on the eve of Indonesia's 52nd anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>He added that the upheavals in the rupiah, which sank to an historic low of 2,960 against the dollar on Friday, one day after it was floated, were temporary.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the appropriate policy and the calmness of domestic players, the exchange rate will find a new equilibrium in line with prevailing economic fundamentals,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The rupiah has shed some 20 percent against the dollar from the beginning of the year, mostly in recent weeks. The currency has been under pressure along with other South East Asian currencies since the Thai baht crisis started in May.</p>
