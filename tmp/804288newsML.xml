<p>India's needs to overhaul its creaking legal system and speed up the judicial process if it is to fight corruption and facilitate economic reforms, Home (interior) Minister Indrajit Gupta said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is already getting late for us to recognise the great danger that the country is now facing,&quot; Gupta told a conference of lawyers in New Delhi to mark the 50th anniversary of independence from British rule in 1947.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot escape the conclusion that there is a crisis in our legal system and in the machinery for (the) administration of justice.&quot; Gupta said.</p>
<p>Gupta's remarks came a day after Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and President K.R. Narayanan called for a mass movement against corruption in televised addresses on the nation's independence day.</p>
<p>&quot;When the law is a dead letter, power will shift into the hands of the criminals and gangsters and we will cease to be a functioning democracy,&quot; Gupta said.</p>
<p>Gupta said India's high courts alone had a backlog of three million cases. Officials say the overall court cases pending in the country's courts at various levels add up to more than 25 million.</p>
<p>&quot;The present system of justice is too expensive and dilatory. It is not working for a large number of litigants,&quot; Gupta said.</p>
<p>&quot;We may have to go back to village panchyats (councils) and local-level institutions for resolving our disputes and differences,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;With economic liberalisation and globalisation, India will need a strong legal framework to sustain high levels of investment and economic growth,&quot; Gupta said.'</p>
<p>&quot;A genuine democracy cannot function or flourish in a society steeped in corruption,&quot; Gupta said. &quot;Corruption has to be dealt with by law and through lawful methods,&quot; he continued.</p>
<p>The calls from a fight against corruption from Gupta and other leaders came in a mood of introspection in the country amidst celebrations to mark the end of colonial rule 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Several leaders from various political parties have been indicted by courts or charged by federal police in the past two years on charges of bribery or criminal cheating.</p>
<p>Public resentment and criticism of political leaders have hit politicians of various hues.</p>
