<p>Jose Maria Olazabal, showing the form of bygone days, climbed into contention with a sparkling seven-under-par 65 in the third round of the Desert Classic on Saturday.</p>
<p>Playing his first tournament for 18 months because of foot problems that threatened to cripple him, Olazabal seized advantage of perfect scoring conditions on a sultry morning at the 7,102-yard Emirates Course.</p>
<p>The Spaniard, once regularly in the world top 10, said his feet still caused him slight problems &quot;but they are no worse than yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>His 65 pushed him to eight under par, just two shots off the lead held by Domingo Hospital as the leaders began their third rounds, and Olazabal did not expect to remain in such a good position.</p>
<p>&quot;They will be scoring well too,&quot; he said of the pacesetters who included Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Ian Woosnam and world number one Greg Norman.</p>
<p>Regardless of how they do, Olazabal does not feel he is yet ready to win.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not expect a 65, that's for sure. I think it will be difficult to win because you have to have more confidence with yourself than I have. I'm not too comfortable on the ball when the pressure is there. That's going to take a toll.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel I need a few more tournaments, a few more weeks, to get the swing I want. Right now it's difficult for me to shape the ball the way I want. I'm not fully confident shaping the ball off the tee.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I have to improve,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Spaniard opened his round with three birdies, from 15 feet at the first, a sand wedge to three feet at the second and a drive and three iron to the green at the long third.</p>
<p>He birdied the 10th and 11th from nine and six feet, the 13th with a superb bunker shot to two feet and the long last hole with a three wood over the lake to the green 45 feet from the pin.</p>
<p>Afterwards he joined in the chorus of sympathy for close friend, Ryder Cup captain Seve Ballesteros, whose woeful form continued as he missed the cut after an 84 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel sad. I have played a lot with him, travelled the world with him, played Ryder Cup with him,&quot; Olazabal said.</p>
<p>&quot;Deep in myself I feel he will overcome it but now he has lost confidence with himself,&quot; Olazabal said.</p>
<p>&quot;He does not feel comfortable at the top of his backswing and when you feel like that you cannot swing the club. He has to find it. He has to feel it.&quot;</p>
