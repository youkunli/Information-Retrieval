<p>Bosnian Moslem leaders visited the graves of dead soldiers on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of Bosnia's declaration of independence from former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>&quot;I am proud that five years ago we did not give in to all those threats and that we voted for freedom, despite everything,&quot; Alija Izetbegovic, Moslem chairman of the country's collective presidency, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The price was high, incalculably high, but we could not keep on living with our heads bent down,&quot; added Izetbegovic, who led the drive for independence.</p>
<p>Bosnian Moslems and Croats voted on March 1, 1992 to secede from Serbian-led Yugoslavia in a referendum which cleared the way for international recognition. Most Bosnian Serbs boycotted the referendum.</p>
<p>War erupted a month later. Bosnian Serb forces, backed by the Yugoslav army, laid siege to the capital Sarajevo and moved to seize control of strategic towns.</p>
<p>Izetbegovic, and the Moslem co-chairman of the new Council of Ministers, Haris Silajdzic, visited Sarajevo's Kovaci cemetry to pay tribute to soldiers killed during the siege of the capital.</p>
<p>Newspaper commentaries said the country had yet to achieve full independence after the 3-1/2 year war, which ended with a peace treaty in 1995.</p>
<p>Sarajevo still had no control over most of the country's international borders and Serb authorities had effectively refused to recognise the authority of the central government, the newspapers said.</p>
<p>&quot;During the war, Bosnia-Herzegovina managed to withstand a total division,&quot; said a commentary published in the daily Oslobodjenje. &quot;Now it is facing a political battle for genuine independence.&quot;</p>
