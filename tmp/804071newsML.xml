<p>Russian Dmitry Sautin, Europe's best men's diver, took an assured victory in the European championship three-metre springboard event on Saturday.</p>
<p>Olympic highboard champion Sautin, 21, retained the title he won in Vienna two years ago with by a margin of more than 50 points over his nearest rival.</p>
<p>Diving with consistency far beyond the rest of the 11-man field, he won the gold medal with 661.68 points after carrying over 234.72 points from his five dives in the semifinal.</p>
<p>Germans Andreas Wels, the winner of the one-metre event on Thursday, and Stefan Ahrens duelled for the silver medal.</p>
<p>Wels took it on the penultimate of his six dives and did not falter with his final effort to score 609.39 points.</p>
<p>Ahrens won bronze with 597.66 points.</p>
<p>However the day belonged to Sautin.</p>
<p>&quot;It was more difficult when I won in Vienna. There the rivals were more dangerous,&quot; Sautin said.</p>
<p>&quot;I was absolutely confident I was going to take the gold. In fact I thought I would take the gold since the beginning of the season.&quot;</p>
<p>Sautin's optimism stemmed from the fact that he was diving pain-free in a major international event for the first time in more than two years.</p>
<p>He injured his left wrist badly during a competition in February 1995 but only had an operation after the Atlanta Olympics.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it's a pleasure to dive once more,&quot; Sautin smiled.</p>
<p>His highlight was a reverse 3-1/2 somersault dive.</p>
<p>Only two other divers attempted one with such great difficulty but neither came close to Sautin's achievement.</p>
<p>The competition was delayed several times by faults with the electronic scoreboard but the Russian said he did not even notice.</p>
<p>&quot;I was concentrating so hard,&quot; Sautin said.</p>
<p>Russia also won the other final on the fourth day of the championships to take their tally to six out of eight gold medals awarded so far.</p>
<p>The synchronised swimming duo of Olga Brusnikina and Maria Kiseleva performing to themes from famous Western films and won with 99.16 points including three perfect 10s for artistic interpretation.</p>
<p>France took the silver medals with 97.04 points while Italy were third with 95.76 points.</p>
