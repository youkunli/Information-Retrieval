<p>Cambodian government forces on Saturday closed to within four to five km (two miles) of the border town where forces loyal to ousted co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh were making a last stand, a senior official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't taken O'Smach yet, but we are optimistic we will take it by tomorrow,&quot; General Meas Sophea, who heads fighting operations for the government, told Reuters in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>But in Siem Reap, a provincial capital about 100 km (60 miles) south of the front lines, incoming wounded from the government side said they had taken O'Smach in the early morning hours without resistance.</p>
<p>Senior commanders could not confirm that report, and Thai authorities near the Cambodian border said O'Smach, which is in northwestern Cambodia near the Thai border, was still held by royalist troops.</p>
<p>Villagers in the area said an artillery shell had exploded in the O'Smach market, killing one civilian and wounding two others.</p>
<p>The shell, believed to have been the first fired by government troops closing in on this last major royalist stronghold, exploded around 10.30 am, villagers hoping to cross into neighbouring Thailand told reporters.</p>
<p>Troops loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen are attempting to finish off royalist forces loyal to co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen ousted last month.</p>
<p>Several hundred troops loyal to Hun Sen have been closing in on O'Smach over the last few days though their advance has been slowed by booby traps, blown bridges, landmines and thick jungle, military official said.</p>
<p>At least three government soliders have been killed and several more, including a senior commander, have been wounded in the advance. Royalist casualties are not known.</p>
<p>Thousands of Cambodian villages from the O'Smach area were poised to cross the border into Thailand, their numbers swelling as the fighting escalated.</p>
<p>The Thai army has pledged to let the villagers cross if the situation warranted it. About 25,000 residents and displaced Cambodians are now estimated to be in the O'Samach area, Thai military sources said.</p>
<p>Some of those crowded against the barbed wire and gates marking the Thai border villages said around 100 Khmer Rouge guerrillas had arrived to reinforce royalist positions on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The guerrillas, some of the last remnants of the once feared Maoist movement, were believed to have travelled from their Anlong Veng base about 50 Km to the east of the border town.</p>
<p>On Friday Khmer Rouge radio said the group had formed an alliance with royalist forces in fighting Hun Sen, though Ranariddh denied the report.</p>
<p>Ranarridh's ragged forces have been defending pockets of territory in the country's north west since Hun Sen siezed power after two days of bloody fighting in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh on July 5-6.</p>
<p>The two had previously been co-premiers in a shaky coalition government.</p>
