<p>Iran said on Saturday it had ordered Turkey's ambassador in Tehran and another Turkish diplomat to leave, two days after Turkey expelled an Iranian consul.</p>
<p>The ambassador and Turkey's consul-general in Orumiyeh were given one week to leave Iran because of &quot;activities incompatible with diplomatic norms&quot;, said a Foreign Ministry statement read on Tehran radio.  </p>
<p>Turkey on Thursday declared Iran's Erzurum chief consul Saeede Zare 'persona non grata' after he accused a senior Turkish military commander of &quot;irresponsibility&quot; for apparently describing Iran as a &quot;terrorist&quot; state.</p>
<p>The two countries entered into a diplomatic row after Ankara protested to Tehran early in February about Iranian ambassador Mohammad Reza Bagheri's comments in favour of Islamic law at an Islamist rally in an Ankara district. Iran later withdrew Bagheri and a consul from Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;Iran considers statements by some Turkish officials against Iran as unacceptable and incompatible with friendly ties between the two countries,&quot; the Iranian statement said. But it said Iran wanted good relations with its neighbours including Turkey.</p>
<p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry said on Friday Tehran had asked Ankara to withdraw the two diplomats from Iran and that the Turkish government was considering the demand.</p>
