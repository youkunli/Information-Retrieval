<p>Thousands of protesters, hurling stones, clashed with outnumbered riot police in Tirana on Saturday and overturned two police vehicles in the latest outbreak of violence in Albania, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Around 5,000 demonstrators, chanting &quot;Freedom!&quot;, &quot;Democracy!&quot; marched from a soccer pitch towards the capital's university campus. Riot police scattered and sought refuge in a residential area near the campus, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders from the Democratic Alliance, the Social Democrats and an association of former political prisoners arrived at the campus to try to calm protesters.</p>
<p>&quot;Calm down. Wait here,&quot; one of the leaders shouted in an attempt to stop the boisterous demonstrators making their way towards the centre of the capital.</p>
<p>The demonstrators had gathered at the site of a rally planned by the opposition Forum for Democracy, which groups 11 opposition parties, including the Democratic Alliance and Social Democrats.</p>
<p>But the Forum called off the rally after the interior ministry withdrew permission citing tension in the country.</p>
<p>Protesters threw stones at the police who had taken up position on the university campus. Police hurled the stones back in an exchange lasting some 20 minutes and then withdrew from the campus.</p>
<p>One student was reported to have been slightly hurt by one of the stones.</p>
<p>Scores of students, who had watched the clash from their dormitory windows, later joined the demonstrators, who shouted &quot;Vlore, Vlore!&quot; in apparent support of three weeks of protests in the southern Albanian town.</p>
<p>The protest came just hours after a gun battle in Vlore where up to nine people were reported killed on Friday night.</p>
