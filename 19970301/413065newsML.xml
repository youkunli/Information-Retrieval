<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he still hoped to reach an agreement on tax reforms with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) but was prepared to proceed without them.</p>
<p>&quot;We will in any case, that means with or without the SPD, press ahead with our plans for a tax reform,&quot; Waigel was quoted telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview.</p>
<p>Waigel said the government would present a draft for the reform this month.</p>
<p>If no agreement was reached with the SPD the package would have to go before the German parliament's arbitration committee, Waigel said in the interview, which the newspaper released ahead of publication in Sunday's edition.</p>
<p>The ruling coalition and the SPD on Friday agreed to hold a third round of talks on March 8 to try and agree on a package of tax changes aimed at giving jobs and investment in Germany a much-needed boost.</p>
<p>&quot;I am still hoping for a settlement in the current talks,&quot; Bild am Sonntag quoted Waigel as saying. &quot;That would be better for all involved -- for the SPD as well -- and would be an important signal to kick-start the economy and create jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>Failure to agree would condemn the measures to long wrangling in parliament, where the SPD can block tax changes through its majority of the upper house, or Bundesrat.</p>
<p>Under discussion is a 30 billion-mark coalition package of tax cuts to be phased in over two years.</p>
<p>It envisages reductions in income and corporate taxes but the SPD opposes a planned cut in the top rate of income tax to 39 percent from 53.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a senior member of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), said the scope for compromise was limited and he was not yet convinced a deal could be reached.</p>
<p>Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary party manager of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), said the parties must establish by Easter whether they can reach agreement because preparing the implementation of the reforms would take at least four months and probably six.</p>
