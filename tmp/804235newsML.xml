<headline>Clinton seeks dismissal of Paula Jones lawsuit.</headline>
<dateline>LITTLE ROCK, Ark 1997-08-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton asked a federal judge on Friday to dismiss the sexual harrassment suit filed against him by Paula Jones.</p>
<p>A brief filed by Clinton's lawyers in federal district court at Little Rock said Jones' lawsuit did not meet the requirements of federal law.</p>
<p>The Jones complaint &quot;fails time and again to plead facts to support crucial elements of a civil rights claim,&quot; said Clinton's brief.</p>
<p>Jones was an Arkansas state employee when Clinton was governor.  She claims Clinton summoned her to a Little Rock hotel room during a business conference and asked her to perform sexual acts, which she said she refused to do.</p>
<p>Clinton has denied the incident and had said he has no memory of Jones. His lawyers said the alleged chain of events, as described by Jones, fell short of the establishing sufficient grounds for filing a sex harassment lawsuit.</p>
<p>&quot;As unwelcome and odious to plaintiff as such alleged conduct may have been, it did not involve force or coercion. Nor is the defendant alleged to have used his state authority to spy on plaintiff, threaten her with arrest or to require her to disrobe,&quot; Clinton's lawyers wrote.</p>
<p>Clinton's brief said Jones lawsuit &quot;does not and cannot allege that she was terminated from her job or suffered any accompanying impairment of continued employment opportunities.&quot;</p>
<p>A judge will conduct a hearing next week on Clinton's motion to dismiss Jones' lawsuit.</p>
