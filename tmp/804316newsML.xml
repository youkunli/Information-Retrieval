<p>Sri Lanka is putting a disastrous year behind it as its People's Alliance (PA) government, which completes three years in power on Saturday, takes measures to boost an economy that nose-dived last year.</p>
<p>A severe drought in the country, which relies mostly on hydropower, dealt a huge blow to the economy in 1996 as industrial and agriculture production fell sharply.</p>
<p>Long power cuts hit corporate performance, pushed investors to the sidelines and sent the stock market into a tailspin.</p>
<p>Overall economic growth fell to 3.6 percent in 1996 from the previous year's 5.5 percent, and inflation touched new heights after a hike in administered prices.</p>
<p>But a dramatic turnaround is expected this year as the government revitalises the economy by easing monetary policy and lowering interest rates, which have given a boost to new investments and helped companies back into profits.</p>
<p>&quot;They (the government) have done well. (For the) first two and a half years they were consolidating their (political) position. Now they are focusing on the economy,&quot; said an analyst with investment house W.I. Carr Indosuez Capital.</p>
<p>Annual average inflation in July fell to 13.9 percent against nearly 16 percent at the end of 1996. The government has forecast six percent overall economic growth for this year.</p>
<p>The budget deficit is expected to narrow this year and the Colombo Stock Exchange all-share index has gained more than 200 points in 1997, indicating renewed investor confidence.</p>
<p>In the past 18 months the government has slashed subsidies, sold state enterprises and used the proceeds to retire debt.</p>
<p>It has also created new thermal electricity capacity to ensure that last year's power cuts are not repeated.</p>
<p>But analysts said the biggest change in three years has been the government's shift to economic issues from its earlier pre-occupation with politics and the 14- year-old ethnic war against Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing the government has learnt is that it can't leave the economy to run itself. They earlier said it was not their business to get involved with the business,&quot; said Azra Jafferjee, an analyst with Jardine Fleming HNB Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;That has now changed. The government, which initially got involved with politics and war, is finally giving the economy a direction,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;(The) weather gods have been fair this year, and credit should be given to the government for addressing the power situation. The war has been curtailed to the north, but the momentum has to be kept up,&quot; Jafferjee said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still a lot that needs to be done. The government seems to be working to a plan and if there is not additional pressure from coalition partners, President Chandrika Kumaratunga should be able to turn the economy around for good,&quot; the W.I. Carr analyst said.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund said earlier this month that Sri Lanka's high fiscal deficit had been a key source of its economic woes over the past years.</p>
<p>It said Sri Lanka needed to press ahead with structural reforms in several key areas like banking. It also said there was a need to keep up the pace of privatisation and reinvigorate trade reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;There is need for structural changes. Public sector spending needs to be lowered since you can't control the defence budget,&quot; she added.</p>
<p>The defence budget for 1997 is 44 billion rupees, or 22 percent of total government spending, down from about 50 billion last year.</p>
