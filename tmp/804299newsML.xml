<p>Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Saturday his government would assure fair play for small industrial units in an economic regime of free market policies.</p>
<p>Gujral said the government was concerned about complaints from small units about unfair competition from big firms and foreign companies after India launched a free market programme in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot;The centre's policy will never be such that anybody can come and throw you out,&quot; Gujral said. &quot;The policies we are trying to make will not be of the 16th century capitalism where anybody can come and overwhelm you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Outsiders are welcome, but not to take over,&quot; Gujral said. &quot;Outsiders are welcome but not to drown us.&quot;</p>
<p>Gujral urged the private sector to increasingly undertake investment to boost the country's economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Without growth, we are doomed,&quot; Gujral told an industry seminar of the Confederation the Indian Industry. &quot;We are inviting the private sector to come in.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 1996/97 fiscal year that ended on March 31, India's gross domestic product grew by 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>Over the past three fiscal years, average annual GDP growth has been seven percent, up from about 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, and 5.5 percent in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P.Chidambaram said the country could achieve an annual growth rate of 8.0 percent if more economic controls were removed.</p>
<p>Gujral said infrastructure growth was needed to boost the development in the economy and the government was taking steps to change old policies and adopt new ones to facilate increased investment in the crucial infrastructure sector.</p>
<p>&quot;We are changing rules which will help the infrastructure sector,&quot; Gujral said.</p>
