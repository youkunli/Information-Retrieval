<p>President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov will meet in Moscow on Monday in a bid to break the deadlock in peace talks between Russia and the breakaway region, Itar-Tass news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The long-awaited meeting, previously postponed due to deep disagreement over Chechnya's status, was announced by Ivan Rybkin, secretary of Russia's Security Council, and Chechen First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov, Tass said.  </p>
<p>Maskhadov, who led Chechen separatists in their 21-month-long bloody conflict with Russian troops that ended last August, insists that his republic is already independent. The Kremlin says Chechnya must stay within the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Maskhadov as saying on Saturday that his trip to Moscow was aimed at establishing full diplomatic relations with Russia befitting two sovereign states.</p>
<p>&quot;The time has come to define our relations and to conclude an all-embracing treaty with the establishment of diplomatic relations,&quot; Interfax quoted him as saying in the Chechen capital Grozny.</p>
<p>On Friday the Kremlin said Yeltsin would put pressure on Maskhadov during their meeting to do more to help free Russian journalists and other hostages held in Chechnya. Maskhadov has been fighting a wave of lawlessness in his tiny Caucasus region since being elected president in January.</p>
