<p>Mexico's Congress on Friday blasted the process by which Washington certified Mexico as a drug ally, and opposition politicians suggested the government may have bowed to tough U.S. conditions to win approval.</p>
<p>&quot;This process allows those who are truly linked to the (drugs) trade in the United States to put up a smoke screen to hide the fact that there are 40 million consumers of drugs in our northern neighbour,&quot; said Augusto Gomez Villanueva, president of the Foreign Relations Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;Eighty percent of the money-laundering in the world takes place there,&quot; Gomez, of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, added.</p>
<p>Cuauhtemoc Sandoval, of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), outlined a list of demands the United States reportedly made to Mexico, which he said may have been accepted by the Mexican government to win certification.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico should reject any type of certification, be it positive or negative,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He alleged that the U.S. conditions included giving agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administraion diplomatic immunity in Mexico and allowing them to carry guns, as well as seeking the extradition of criminals in Mexican jails to the United States.</p>
<p>All such demands would be highly unpopular in Mexico, which sees the United States as largely responsible for the problem because it is the world's biggest drug market.</p>
<p>Anger over the certification process has run deep. On Thursday, misplaced fears that Mexico would not win certification sent the country's financial markets into a plunge.</p>
<p>&quot;The free fall of the exchange rate and the fluctuations on the stock market in recent days are eloquent of the economic power of our neighbour's political provocations,&quot; the PRD said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that it has been granted certification, we need to ask the Mexican government how many of these petitions they agreed to fully, or if it was only some of them,&quot; Sandoval said.</p>
<p>Ricardo Garcia Cervantes, parliamentary leader of the conservative National Action Party, also attacked the process as &quot;absolutely insuitable,&quot; saying it did more harm than good.</p>
<p>But he appeared pleased by President Clinton's decision to certify Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;To me it is an expression of the maturity, common sense and objectivity that the relationship can produce,&quot; he said.</p>
