<p>Bordeaux moved a step closer to a domestic cup double when they beat Cannes 1-0 to reach the French Cup quarter-finals on Saturday.</p>
<p>Striker Didier Tholot scored the winner for home side Bordeaux, who are already in the League Cup final, 16 minutes into the third round tie, the earliest of six.</p>
<p>Kaba Diawara's header from midfielder Francois Grenet's cross from the right was saved by Francois Lemasson, but the Cannes goalkeeper was on his knees and helpless when Tholot blasted home the rebound.</p>
<p>Lemasson also saved a Diawara header in the dying minutes.</p>
<p>Bordeaux's veteran Belgian goalkeeper Gilbert Bodart, the hero of their League Cup semifinal penalty shoot-out win over Montpellier, saved a point blank header from Cannes striker Cedrid Mouret early in the second half.</p>
<p>Tholot's substitute Jean-Pierre Papin put the ball in the net with a trademark volley three minutes after coming on but the referee blew up for offside by the former France striker.</p>
<p>Holders Auxerre, who have won the French Cup twice in the last three seasons, crashed out to second division Troyes on Friday, five days before they meet Borussia Dortmund away in the first leg of their European Cup quarter-final.</p>
<p>Lille are at home to Montpellier on Sunday in one of three all-first division ties.</p>
