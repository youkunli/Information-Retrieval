<p>Women from across Africa gathered in Rwanda on Saturday for talks on bringing peace to the war-torn continent.</p>
<p>The pan-African Peace, Gender and Development conference, which follows the Beijing women's conference in 1995, will last three days and focus on identifying causes of conflicts and ways to resolve them.</p>
<p>The conference, whose participants include some men, is organised by Rwanda women's groups with the Organisation of African Unity and United Nations bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;The major causes of conflict will be identified and analysed and traditional methods and practices of conflict resolution will be shared and reviewed,&quot; a statement from the conference said.</p>
<p>Conflict is never far from the surface in Rwanda where a U.N. human rights report said on Friday that January, with at least 424 killings, had been the most violent month for almost a year in the ethnically-polarised country.</p>
<p>Over 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered in three months of killings in 1994 that ended when the current Tutsi-dominated army took over from a Hutu-led government.</p>
<p>The latest wave of insecurity coincides with the return of over a million Hutu refugees late last year who had fled to Zaire and Tanzania fearing reprisals for the genocide.</p>
<p>&quot;(The conference) will highlight the efforts of Rwandan women in combatting intolerance and politically motivated divisions in society and in particular their contributions to social reintegration, peace and development after the 1994 genocide and massacres,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>On Friday state-run radio said a special genocide court in the southern town of Gitarama had delivered the first death sentence to a woman, Virginia Mukankusi, for her part in the 1994 killings.</p>
<p>Several hundred kilometres (miles) to the east, Africa's latest war rages in mineral-rich Zaire as rebels fight to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko, in power for 31 years.</p>
<p>Guests at the conference include Sophie Buyoya, wife of neighbouring Burundi's military leader Pierre Buyoya who took power in a coup last July.</p>
<p>Burundi is gripped by a vicious war between Buyoya's Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu insurgents fighting for a greater political say.</p>
<p>Irish president Mary Robinson is scheduled to arrive on Saturday night and address the conference on Sunday.</p>
<p>On Monday the conference will prepare a declaration to highlight efforts to end over a dozen conflicts which plague the world's poorest continent.</p>
<p>&quot;It will call for specific measures to be taken by women, governments, the civil society and the private sector in order to intensify those efforts and strengthen the critical participation of women in peace processes,&quot; a statement said.</p>
