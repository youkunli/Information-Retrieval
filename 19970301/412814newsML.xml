<p>The ready-to-drink sector of the U.S. coffee market has had little success, but Maxwell House Coffee Co.'s director of strategy and new business development said it may hold the key to attracting young consumers.</p>
<p>&quot;Ready-to-drink coffee is known as the Holy Grail of the coffee business,&quot; said Jeri Finard. &quot;But it may be the way to go to get young adults to drink coffee.&quot;</p>
<p>Finard, who was speaking at the National Coffee Federation convention, said sales of ready-to-drink coffee accounted for only one percent of the total U.S. coffee market in 1996. Sales peaked in 1994 at $47 million, but were around $40 million in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>With coffee consumption by drinkers in their 20s declining to about a half a cup per day in 1996 from 1.75 cups in 1970, manufacturers have tried unsuccessfully to lure young consumers with various ready-to-drink products.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of American manufacturers have been testing, but so far ready-to-drink coffee has not proven to be profitable,&quot; Finard said. &quot;For ready-to-drink coffee to succeed, it has to range from indulgent to refreshing.&quot;</p>
<p>Most ready-to-drink products have been on the indulgent side, she said, more like sweet and creamy milkshakes -- with plenty of calories to go along.</p>
<p>However, she was encouraged by the popularity of coffeehouse drinks, noting the success some retail ice coffee drinks have had in attracting new, younger drinkers.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to be patient and allow this market to develop slowly,&quot; Finard said. &quot;Given time, these cold coffees will one day be hot.&quot;</p>
