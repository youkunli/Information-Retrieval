<p>Duriron Co Inc said on Friday that it expects first quarter earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.48.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect margins and earnings for the first quarter of 1997 to be between levels seen during the first two quarters of 1996,&quot; chairman, president and chief executive William Jordan said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company said its first quarter results would be a record for the period, but First Call's consensus estimate of analysts' earnings expectations for the first quarter are $0.52 a share.  </p>
<p>Duriron reported earnings per share of $0.41 in last year's first quarter on sales of $149.2 million. In last year's second quarter, the company's operating earnings per share before a charge totaled $0.48 on sales of $151.1 million.</p>
<p>Shipments for the period will be below expectations and two of its orders will not be shipped until the second quarter, instead of the first, the company said.</p>
<p>Regarding the company's outlook for the year, Duriron said it is confident to achieve its annual goals based on market activity and its order backlog.</p>
<p>The company said its operating pressure will be on increasing shipping performance and continuing to improve margins.</p>
