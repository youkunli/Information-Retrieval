<headline>Three wounded in Spain gun battle, mistaken identity.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>One Basque national policeman and two civil guards were injured on Saturday in the northern Spanish city of Bilbao when they mistakenly fired on one another, local media reported.</p>
<p>The gun battle, which took place shortly after a car bomb exploded in Bilbao late on Friday, occurred when a national police patrol stopped to check a car following it that the officers mistakenly considered suspicious.</p>
<p>The wounded were taken to nearby hospitals and two were operated on for abdominal and leg wounds.</p>
<p>Rebels of the ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) movement have killed some 800 people in their 30-year drive for Basque independence and have stepped up the tempo of the violence this year.</p>
