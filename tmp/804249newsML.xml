<p>German police, engaged in a tense cat-and-mouse game with neo-Nazis, on Saturday detained more than 100 people suspected of heading for rallies to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.</p>
<p>Police in the central state of Hesse said they had taken 78 people into temporary custody at traffic checkpoints set up to stop extremists holding secret gatherings in defiance of widespead bans on Hess rallies over the weekend.</p>
<p>A Hesse police spokesman said officers had seized knives, music cassettes and placards with extremist slogans.</p>
<p>In the eastern state of Thuringia, police detained 31 right-wing extremists for inciting racial hatred and displaying sybols of anti-constitutional organisations, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Special information lines run by neo-Nazi groups had told members to have plenty of petrol in their cars and fresh batteries for mobile telephones so they could get to rallies without having to stop at motorway service stations.</p>
<p>The extremists have kept their plans top secret in a bid to outwit both police and the media. Some reports had suggested the neo-Nazis may be planning a central gathering somewhere in Germany but police said there were no clear indications so far.</p>
<p>In the eastern city of Halle, around 40 left-wing demonstrators attacked about 50 right-wingers holding a small rally to mark Hess's death in the city centre. Five of the left-wingers were detained over the scuffles, police said.</p>
<p>Hess hanged himself with an electric cord in Berlin's Spandau prison on August 17, 1987, and the date has become a rallying point for the radical right in Germany and other European countries.</p>
<p>Some neo-Nazi groups claim he was murdered by the Allies, making him a martyr to their nationalist cause.</p>
<p>Last year German police detained 160 right-wing activists on the ninth anniversary, while hundreds of neo-Nazis battled with police in Sweden, Norway and Germany's neighbour Denmark, which permits such rallies.</p>
<p>Several German states have imposed blanket bans on Hess rallies this weekend and officials have said they believe many neo-Nazis may head for events in Denmark.</p>
<p>Twenty-four neo-Nazis and anti-Nazi anarchists were arrested in Denmark on Saturday as they headed towards the small town of Roskilde, which was expected to be at the centre of rallies by both leftists and right-wing extremists.</p>
