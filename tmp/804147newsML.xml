<p>Indonesia's President Suharto said on Saturday the country's election campaign rules must be altered to prevent the recurrence of violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Democracy does not need victims. A general election that ensures a democratic process and proceeds smoothly, peacefully...and does not claim human lives and property losses must become one of our political development agendas in the future,&quot; he said in a speech to the nation on the eve of the country's 52nd anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>&quot;We have sufficient time until the next general election -- to think about the best possible ways of conducting general election campaigns,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Last May, Indonesia elected 425 members of the 500-member House of Representatives after an election campaign that was regarded as the most violent during the 30 years of Suharto's rule.</p>
<p>Authorities say more than 300 people died during the campaign, mostly from traffic accidents, while 124 died in a shopping centre fire during a riot in South Kalimantan province. Most of them were people looting the shops in the plaza.</p>
<p>But there were also several other riots during the campaign, which political analysts have said reflected the restlessness of a population increasingly aware of the limitations of Indonesia's political system.</p>
<p>Under Suharto's sometimes autocratic rule, only three political parties -- the ruling Golkar, the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) and the Christian-Nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) -- are allowed to contest elections.</p>
<p>Campaigning is prohibited except for a four-week period preceding general elections and contestants are expected to refrain from direct criticism of each other and the government.</p>
<p>The country's powerful military, which does not vote, are given 75 seats in parliament, many filled by senior generals. Suharto is also a former army general.</p>
<p>Golkar took 74 percent of the votes cast in the election, with the PPP winning 23 percent and the badly fractured PDI picking up three percent.</p>
<p>Indonesia's best-known opposition figure, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was barred from participating in the poll.</p>
<p>Megawati, the daughter of late founding president and Suharto's predecessor, Sukarno, was ousted from the PDI leadership last year by a government-backed rival.</p>
<p>She asked her supporters to boycott the May general election campaign. Megawati stopped short of an illegal call to boycott the elections, although she said she herself would not vote.</p>
<p>Suharto said voter turnout was impressive despite these efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can deny the fact that 90 percent of the Indonesian people exercised their voting right... There are not many countries in the world that equal this feat,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That was in spite of the fact that around the time of the general elections there were several intensive activities designed to influence the people not to vote,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently, the Indonesian people were not easily swayed by appeals that would destroy the system and degrade our democratic standing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some disturbances took place that apparently were incited by those who intended to sabotage the general election or at least discredit it,&quot; he said.</p>
