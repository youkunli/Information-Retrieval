<headline>U.S. doubts Adams would seek visa.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. State Department on Friday signaled doubt that Sein Fein president Gerry Adams would seek or receive a visa to visit the United States any time soon.</p>
<p>Adams, who heads the political wing of the IRA, has sought and received visas to come to Washington in each of the last two years around the time of March 17, St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the White House would have a St. Patrick's Day party this year as usual but Adams &quot;has not applied for a visa ... I would doubt he would apply for a visa.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he did apply for a visa, well,we'd have to just look at the circumstances at the time he applied for the visa, and we'd have to ascertain whether or not issuing that visa waiver would contribute to momentum in the peace negotiations that are being led by former Senator George Mitchell,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>But he made clear that the Clinton administration, which heavily courted Adams in past years, now considers him and the IRA an obstacle to peace.</p>
<p>He said the United States &quot;continues to be outraged by the resumption of Irish Republican Army terrorism in Northern Ireland. And we continue to support the peace process in Northern Ireland, and we urge the IRA to restore an immediate cease-fire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of a cease-fire, the United States will continue to endorse fully and completely the position of the British government and the Irish government, and that is that Sinn Fein is not welcome and cannot participate in the multi-party talks unless this pledge of cease-fire and the reality of a cease-fire are met,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Burns called the recent violence despicable and said: &quot;The United States will stand by the United Kingdom and the government of Ireland in insisting that there's no place for Gerry Adams of the Sinn Fein or anyone else from that organization at the multi-party talks until this cease-fire is implemented.&quot;</p>
<p>New Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has signaled her intention to reclaim authority over foreign policy matters -- like Northern Ireland -- that had been directed from the National Security Council and other agencies and has taken a much tougher line on Northern Ireland than her predecessor.</p>
