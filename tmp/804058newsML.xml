<p>California teenager Troy Dumais, the diver some are calling the next Greg Louganis, won his second national title Friday night at the USA Senior National Diving Championships.</p>
<p>Dumais, 17, of Ventura, California, defended his 1-metre springboard title, a non-Olympic event. He qualified for the September 10-14 World Cup championships in Mexico City and world aquatic championships in Perth, Australia, in January.</p>
<p>Dumais topped a 29-diver field, pared down to six for the final round. He totaled 399.33 points for six dives. Five out of six of his dives had a degree of difficulty of 3.0 and higher.</p>
<p>Last week, Dumais broke the national record for most junior titles (16) at the junior national championships. Dumais narrowly missed making the 1996 U.S. Olympic team, finishing third on 3-metres at the Olympic trials.</p>
<p>Several coaches have compared Dumais to the great Louganis for his strength and artistry on the boards. Louganis won four Olympic gold and one silver medals in three Olympics (1976, 1984, 1988) before retiring in 1988.</p>
<p>&quot;It is flattering to be compared to Greg Louganis, he is the greatest of all time,&quot; Dumais said. &quot;But I would rather be known for myself and my own dives and not be compared to any other diver.&quot;</p>
<p>The seven-day World Cup and world championship qualifying meet continues through Sunday. It is only the second major diving meet in the United States since the Summer Olympics in Atlanta.</p>
