<p>South Koreas main opposition party said on Saturday it could not confirm a North Korean media report that one of its members had defected to Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not able to confirm the report that Oh Ik-jae, who holds membership in our party, defected to North Korea, said Park Sun-suck, a spokeswoman for the National Congress for New Politics, stressing that Oh Ik-jae currently held no formal party position.  </p>
<p>The South Korean government-run news agency, Nae-woe Press, quoted North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) as saying Oh Ik-jae told reporters on his arrival in Pyongyang on Friday that he did not come to the North for a short visit or for tourism.</p>
<p>In a separate statement the National Congress demanded that a thorough investigation be conducted by the government.</p>
<p>&quot;The party will also conduct an investigation, and if the report is true Oh will be expelled from the party. It was extremely shocking to hear the report of Oh Ik-jae's defection to the North and, if the report is true, it is very unfortunate and shameful to the Korean people,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Oh, 68, has previously headed the 130-year-old Chondokyo religious group. He has also served on the Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification, a presidential advisory body.</p>
