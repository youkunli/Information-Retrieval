<p>Alexander Lebed, former security chief and would-be president, warned on Saturday that Russia's current leadership would try to whip up trouble in conflict zones to distract attention from the country's social ills.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia has reached a dead end and the authorities will be forced to seek an external enemy or powerful distraction,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Lebed as saying during a trip to the city of Chelyabinsk in the Ural mountains.</p>
<p>Lebed said one possible distraction would be reviving conflicts in former Soviet trouble-spots like Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region or in Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Lebed, a charismatic former soldier who makes no secret of his desire to succeed President Boris Yeltsin, repeated his warning that Russia was falling apart and needed a new leader.</p>
<p>&quot;The president is incapable (of working)...He does not rule the country. Russia is about to fall apart. That is why in a choice between a country of 150 million and the president, I choose the country,&quot; he told NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>Lebed, who came a strong third in last summer's presidential contest, served briefly as secretary of the policy-making Security Council before Yeltsin sacked him for insubordination.</p>
<p>&quot;I am stubborn, I shall come back,&quot; said Lebed, who has recently made well-publicised trips to France and the United States.</p>
<p>He told Interfax he expected &quot;several heads (in the government) to roll&quot; next week after Yeltsin's annual address to parliament. Yeltsin has made clear he wants a government reshuffle soon to help defuse rising social tensions over unpaid wages and pensions and a continuing economic slump.</p>
