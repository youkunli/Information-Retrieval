<p>A Filipino fashion designer murdered in Saudi Arabia last month is expected to be buried in the kingdom's holy Moslem city of Mecca, a Saudi newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The English-language Arab News daily said the Philippines Embassy was seeking permission for the burial of 42-year-old Amoran Macausor in Mecca, home to Islam's holiest shrine.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole task may take a few days. It will not happen immediately,&quot; one embassy official told the daily.</p>
<p>Police found the Filipino Moslem stabbed to death in the eastern city of al-Khobar on February 15. He had been living in Saudi for 14 years and owned a men's garment store together with a Saudi partner.</p>
<p>The victim's uncle and brother, who arrived in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to help investigators and arrange his burial, asked that Macausor be buried in Mecca. They will also settle his financial accounts, it said.</p>
<p>Embassy officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>A Philippines diplomat said last week that more than 10 people were detained in connection with the murder and several remained in custody.</p>
<p>About half a million Filipinos live and work in Saudi Arabia. Some four million Filipinos work overseas, about a million in the Gulf.</p>
