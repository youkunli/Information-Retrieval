<p>Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Saturday that he was worried agricultural productivity was languishing, and urged the development of new seeds and dry farming to ensure a healthy farm sector.</p>
<p>&quot;Agriculture is an important sector. There are some reasons to be satisfied about it, but there are many reasons not to be satisfied about it,&quot; he told a business conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).</p>
<p>&quot;I think productivity is now causing anxiety....I see the ominous signs (of productivity), I hate, I hesitate to use the word, coming towards a halt. And if that halt comes, we'll be in difficulty,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore I have told the agriculture universities, specially their research and development departments, that they must emphasise a great deal on finding new seeds,&quot; Gujral said.</p>
<p>India's oilseeds production had been stagnant since 1993/94 (July-June), with an annual output of about 22 million tonnes harvested from an area of about 26 million hectares.</p>
<p>The per-hectare yield of rice declined in 1995/96 (July-June) to 1,855 kg from 1,911 in the previous crop year. Wheat yield fell to 2,493 kg per hectare from 2,559 kg.</p>
<p>The conference was organised to mark the 50th anniversary of India's independence from Britain.</p>
<p>He said water availability was becoming a problem and increased efforts were needed to develop new technologies for farming with less water.</p>
<p>&quot;Our research and development must aim towards dry farming,&quot; Gujral said. &quot;As water problem continues, we have to think of new technologies.&quot;</p>
<p>India, under an economic reforms programme initiated in 1991, removed state controls on most sectors, but controls continue to exist in many areas of the agriculture sector.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told the same conference that agriculture was one on the most over-regulated sectors and urged industry to support a special emphasis this year to remove controls over prices, trade and exports.</p>
<p>&quot;Agriculture is perhaps the most over-regulated sector in India's economy,&quot; Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't allow free movement of foodgrains and other agriculture products. We don't allow consolidation of holdings (of land). We don't allow corporatisation of any part of agriculture,&quot; Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>He said India's farmers were not getting proper credit facilities. &quot;They are also not allowed to raise credit from abroad even if they have the repaying capability,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are talking about removing controls on industry,&quot; Chidambaram said. &quot;Why are we not talking of removing controls on agriculture?</p>
