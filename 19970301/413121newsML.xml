<p>A French diplomat said on Saturday he would visit officials of the militant Taleban movement on Sunday to discuss the plight of two imprisoned French aid workers.</p>
<p>&quot;Tomorrow I have an appointment with the (Taleban) Attorney-General, and I am continuing to carry on my contacts with the other authorities,&quot; French Charge d'Affaires Didier Leroy told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said he had been given free access to the detained men and that he was satisfied that they were being well treated.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been able to see the prisoners every day. The prison guards and the director of the prison are taking good care of them,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Frenchmen Frederic Michel and Jose Daniel Llorente, who work for the Paris-based charity Action Contre la Faim (Action Against Hunger), were arrested a week ago.</p>
<p>The are being investigated for &quot;immoral acts&quot; which were allegedly committed during a lunch given by the charity's female expatriate staff for their female Afghan colleagues.</p>
<p>The Taleban, a militant Islamic and mainly Pushtun-speaking militia, has overrun much of southern Afghanistan in its attempt to impose a strict fundamentalist order.</p>
