<p>The head of Sudan's exiled opposition said on Saturday that he rejected bilateral talks with the Khartoum government as a way to end 14 years of civil war in Africa's largest country.</p>
<p>Mohammed Osman al-Mirghani was responding to a request for the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA) reaction to Sudan President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's call for a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Mirghani said in a statement that &quot;the view of the NDA...is that bilateral negotiations with the regime will not achieve peace in Sudan&quot;.</p>
<p>Bashir had made the ceasefire call on Tuesday during a visit to South Africa.</p>
<p>Mirghani is president of the Cairo-based NDA, an umbrella group of northern and southern opposition parties including Umma party, Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and other groups. He also heads the DUP.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a solution to the crisis, because the nature of the (parliament speaker Hassan) Turabi and Bashir regime since its inception has been one of aggression and against peace, democracy and human rights,&quot; he said in the statement sent to Reuters.</p>
<p>Mirghani said he had met Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to discuss the situation in Egypt's neighbour Sudan.</p>
<p>The statement said Mirghani also met ambassadors of member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a group of African countries working on an initiative to end the war, being fought mostly in the south and northeast.</p>
<p>IGAD groups Kenya, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Somalia and Djibouti.</p>
<p>Mirghani said he conveyed the NDA view in letters to the presidents of Uganda, Kenya, Eritrea, and the prime minister of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Bashir's government and John Garang, leader of the SPLA, which does most of the fighting, are due to start a series of talks in Nairobi on August 19.</p>
<p>The war in Sudan pits Christian and animist rebels in the south against the Moslem and Arabised north. The rebels want greater autonomy or independence from the north.</p>
