<p>A plan to use video cameras as an aid to the referee in an international friendly between France and Sweden later this month was turned down at a meeting of the International Football Board on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very grateful to television for promoting our game and also for bringing in financial resources. But we do not want television to control our game, we do not want television to take over the responsibilities of the referee,&quot; FIFA Secretary General, Sepp Blatter, said after the meeting of the International Board, soccer's ultimate law-making authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Our game will have to live with human errors and passion. If it becomes a scientific game that is not good. Television should be a good partner, but not control the game,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>If the proposal had been accepted, it would have allowed the referee to consult a television monitor at the side of the pitch to help him determine questionable incidents during play.</p>
<p>There has been a huge demand for video technology to be allowed at matches this week in England, following a controversial penalty awarded in an F.A. Cup match between Chelsea and Leicester on Wednesday. The match, which Chelsea won 1-0 with a penalty three minutes before the end of extra time, became the subject of intense media interest after TV replays showed the referee had wrongly awarded the deciding spot-kick.</p>
<p>But Saturday's ruling by the International Board, and Blatter's comments would appear to rule out the use of any video technology for the foreseeable future.</p>
