<p>Tribal militants attacked two villages in northeastern India killing 13 people and wounding eight, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bodo guerrillas shot the victims on Friday night in Nalbari district, about 50 km (30 miles) west of Guwahati, the largest city in Assam state.</p>
<p>The dead included five women, they said.</p>
<p>Police in Guwahati said the insurgents also set several houses on fire in the villages before fleeing.</p>
<p>&quot;The victims were called out of their houses and indiscriminately fired upon,&quot; an Assam police official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The attacks were the latest in a mounting campaign of violence in the northeast, where dozens of militant groups are fighting Indian rule across several states.</p>
<p>The state government of Assam has imposed an indefinite curfew in areas where the killings occurred.</p>
<p>More than one thousand people have been killed since 1985 in violence linked to a Bodo ethnic movement for a separate province. A small group is also fighting for independence.</p>
<p>Officials said they could not immediately say which community the victims belonged to.</p>
<p>Bodo tribal militants usually target Bengali-speaking Hindu settlers in their traditional homeland.</p>
<p>Security officials said they had begun combing the area for the guerrillas.</p>
<p>The rebels have stepped up the attacks to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Indian independence, which was celebrated on Friday.</p>
<p>Separatist groups observed a general strike on Friday, with a call to boycott the celebrations.</p>
<p>On Friday, militants killed four people in Assam and two others in nearby Tripura state.</p>
<p>The militants say the Indian government has neglected the region's needs and exploited its economic resources.</p>
