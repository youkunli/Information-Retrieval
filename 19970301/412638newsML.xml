<p>Norway's Lasse Kjus was denied a victory at a men's Alpine World Cup downhill on Saturday when the race was declared invalid just two skiers short of being official.</p>
<p>Gusting winds had delayed the start of the race 90 minutes and then brought about its abrupt conclusion when the minimum number of 30 skiers were unable to complete the race.</p>
<p>The required 30 racers did leave the start but two, Switzerland's Markus Herrmann and Austria's Roland Assinger, were flagged down before they could complete their run and did not get an opportunity to restart.</p>
<p>&quot;Racers number 26 and 30 had no chance to finish their runs,&quot; explained World Cup race director Gunther Hujara. &quot;If they had fallen or stopped for some other reason it would have been all right but we stopped them.</p>
<p>&quot;In our opinion the rule was not fulfilled and the jury voted three-to-one to not count the race.&quot;</p>
<p>The near hurricane-like conditions played havoc with the race all day. A woman spectator was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Lillehammer when a scoreboard in the finish area was blown over breaking her pelvis.</p>
<p>The winds also forced officials to remove the finish line banner and ripped the signage lining the course from the fencing.</p>
<p>The rain that caused the cancellation of Friday's training, combined with freezing overnight temperatures to turn the Olympiabakken course into a rockhard sheet of ice adding to the treacherous conditions.</p>
<p>Being forced to race in such conditions angered many skiers including France's Luc Alphand, the leader of the downhill, super-G and overall World Cup standings.</p>
<p>&quot;It's absolute madness to run the race in these windy conditions,&quot; fumed Alphand, who would have locked up his third straight downhill title with his seventh place finish.</p>
<p>Austria's Hannes Trinkl, who crashed but was uninjured, said later, &quot;I will consider suing FIS for making us race in these conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Just before Kjus was set to push out of the start hut the race was stopped for 10 minutes to allow course workers to repair some safety screening that was blowing across the course.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a brief lull in the conditions, Kjus rocketed down the 2,641 metre layout in a time of one minute, 28.07 seconds, crossing almost a second ahead of Austria's Patrick Ortlieb who was clocked at 1:29.03.</p>
<p>Canada's Ed Podivinsky, who claimed a bronze medal on the same course at the 1992 Olympics, was third quickest in 1:29.19.</p>
<p>&quot;The wind was a problem when I was jumping but it was from the side not from front,&quot; said Kjus, whose last downhill win had come on the Olympic course in 1996. &quot;It came in gusts and it was hard to predict which direction it would come.&quot;</p>
<p>The downhill has been rescheduled for 8:00 (GMT) on Sunday followed by the scheduled super-G at 12:00 (GMT).</p>
