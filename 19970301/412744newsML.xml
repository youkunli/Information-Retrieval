<p>Holders the United States, coached by Martina Navratilova, restored their Fed Cup credentials against the Netherlands on Saturday when Chanda Rubin beat Brenda Schultz-McCarthy 4-6 6-4 6-3 to level their world group first round tie 1-1.</p>
<p>The Dutch had taken a 1-0 lead after Miriam Oremans, who served 13 aces, beat Mary Joe Fernandez 6-1 6-4 in the opening match.</p>
<p>Fernandez, who had not played since the Australian Open because of a wrist injury, lost her service twice in the first set and once in the second. She is the only one left from the Fed Cup team that beat Spain 5-0 in last year's final.</p>
<p>Navratilova was making her debut as coach on Saturday, taking over from Billie-Jean King. In her playing career Navratilova never lost a Fed Cup match.</p>

<p>Schultz-McCarthy started well and took the first set when Rubin double-faulted.</p>
<p>The Netherlands seemed headed for a surprise 2-0 lead over the 15-times cup holders, but Schultz-McCarthy's service faltered halfway through the second set as Rubin started to play better.</p>
<p>Rubin took the second set and broke Schultz-McCarthy three times in the final set to level the tie.</p>
