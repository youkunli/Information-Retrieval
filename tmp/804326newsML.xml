<headline>UPS, union resume marathon talks after recess.</headline>

<p>Negotiators for United Parcel Service and the Teamsters union continued marathon talks after taking a brief break on Saturday as the strike against the giant package delivery firm entered its 13th day.</p>
<p>The two sides, who began their latest round of informal talks on Thursday morning at the urging of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, bargained through the night on Friday before taking a brief break in the predawn hours to freshen up and take naps, a Labor Department spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;They're hunkered down,&quot; the spokesman said a few hours after daybreak on Saturday. &quot;They just took a few hours off.&quot;</p>
<p>Spokesmen for chief federal mediator John Calhoun Wells and Herman, who was staying in the Washington hotel where the meetings were held, declined to say whether any progress has been made or precisely when talks would resume.</p>
<p>On Friday, Herman spokeswoman Susan King said the nation's biggest package delivery firm and second-largest union redoubled their efforts to reach a settlement in meetings that were at times face-to-face and at other times held in separate rooms with mediators shuttling between them.</p>
<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey praised Herman and Wells for their &quot;superb job&quot; in keeping the talks alive.</p>
<p>But he said no agreements had been reached on any of the issues in the dispute and announced plans for rallies in 30 U.S. cities next week to drum up support for the 185,000 UPS workers on strike. He said unions representing UPS workers in several European countries also were planning job actions.</p>
<p>&quot;A contract that provides the good jobs for working families certainly won't be won at the bargaining table,&quot; he told a Friday news conference. &quot;The only way you can win that is either on the picket lines, and in the community.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly buoyed by opinion polls showing the strikers winning the lion's share of public support, Carey declared his resolve not to back down from the union's demand that UPS convert more part-time jobs into higher paying full-time jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;The Teamster fight for good full-time jobs has become America's fight as well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The UPS workers have been on strike since Aug. 4 to demand full-time status and benefits for some of the company's many part-time employees. A key company demand has been to withdraw from its current multi-employer pension plans and set up a plan solely for Teamster members at UPS.</p>
<p>The walkout is the biggest since a three-day strike by 400,000 Teamster truckers in 1976, according to Richard Hurd, director of labor studies at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.</p>
<p>The strikers were getting help from other unions, but were finding it tough to live on $55-a-week strike benefits, while the company estimated $300 million in lost revenue a week, putting its losses so far at about $500 million or more.</p>
<p>UPS competitors, including the U.S. Postal Service, have rushed to try to fill the void, but many small businesses are feeling the pinch of being unable to deliver their goods.</p>
<p>Among those feeling the effects of the work stoppage is a major U.S. blood bank that reported it had to destroy more than 800 pints of blood because overburdened delivery companies Federal Express Corp. and Airborne Express could no longer guarantee their usual overnight delivery.</p>
