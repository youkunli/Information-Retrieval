<title>AUSTRALIA: Mercenaries land on PNG island - rebels.</title>

<p>Mercenaries hired by the Papua New Guinea government have landed on the island of Bougainville, supporters of the island's secessionists said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The rebel Bougainville Revolutionary Army had detected 170 of the mercenaries on the island, a spokeswoman for the secessionists told the Australian Associated Press in Sydney.</p>
<p>The Australian Foreign Affairs Department meanwhile said any Australians on the mineral-rich island could be mistaken for mercenaries and should leave as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;Press reports that members of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army have orders to shoot on sight 'anybody without a clearance' must be taken seriously since there is a danger they could apply to any foreigners in Bougainville,&quot; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea said last week it had hired Sandline International, a British-based supplier of mercenaries that had subcontracted the job to South Africa's Executive Outcomes, a private army.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea said it had hired Sandline to train its soldiers waging a nine-year war against the rebels on Bougainville, which is 800 km (500 miles) north east of the capital, Port Moresby.</p>
<p>Australia has led the international diplomatic push against the use of mercenaries, warning Port Moresby that its persistence with the plan would damage its international relations.</p>
<p>Australian media reports said that the deal involved up to 150 mercenaries but that only about 40 were expected to go to Bougainville.</p>
