<p>Political protest exploded into bloody anarchy in the southern Albanian town of Vlore as angry demonstrators fought a gun-battle with secret police. At least six people died, 22 were injured and a mob beat a policeman to death in a street.</p>
<p>The town hospital said three civilians, including a 14-year-old boy, were shot dead on Friday night in the worst violence seen in Albania since bread riots that cost 40 lives in 1991.</p>
<p>The National Information Service, or secret police, known as the Shik, said two of their men were shot dead by protesters and another was dragged away and beaten to death by a mob.</p>
<p>The Shik confirmed earlier eyewitness accounts that protesters and secret police officers engaged in a two-hour gun battle outside their headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;Armed terrorist bands, with more than 27 cars and about 60 to 70 people, attacked the building of the Information Service... at about 9 p.m. (2000 GMT), without any warning, opening fire from four sides of the building with automatic arms and explosive grenades,&quot; the Shik said in a statement.</p>
<p>Witnesses at Vlore university, where 42 students have been on hunger strike for 10 days, said the violence erupted after a man was apparently stabbed by police. He was treated for his wounds at the town hospital and later released.</p>
<p>The hospital said protesters Fatmir Tozaj, 34, Shkelqim Bogdani, 33, and Artur Zoto, 14, had been shot dead.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now two rivers in Vlore -- one is called Vjose and the other our children's blood,&quot; one man told a reporter at the university building.</p>
<p>The Shik denied that its officers had planned to storm the university to force students to vacate the building and accused opposition Socialists of instigating the violence.</p>
<p>The students have been supported by thousands of Vlore townsfolk who have paraded through the streets of the Adriatic port town every day for the past three weeks.</p>
<p>The students have also become a beacon of escalating protests by other university students and high school pupils across the impoverished Balkan state, who have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi's government.</p>
<p>Anti-government demonstrations erupted in Albania in January when hundreds of thousands of people learned they had lost nearly everything they owned in five pyramid investment schemes that went bust.</p>
<p>Savers turned their fury against President Sali Berisha and his Democratic Party government for failing to warn them the investment funds were highly risky.</p>
<p>Berisha, who was certain to secure re-election to a fresh five-year term in office in a parliamentary vote on Monday, acknowledged that the government should have acted earlier but also said investors had learned a hard lesson of capitalism.</p>
<p>Vlore, where around 40 percent of the 80,000 residents were believed to have poured their savings into the Gjallica fund and other schemes, was particularly hard hit.</p>
<p>A witness said townsfolk seized an arsenal of weapons in the police building, including handguns, Kalashnikov rifles and machine guns in a move which could spark further violence.</p>
<p>Armed protesters were now protecting students in the university with three people posted at each window, he said.</p>
<p>Reporters in Tirana saw five army trucks driving into the capital, where the opposition Forum for Democracy, grouping 11 opposition parties, planned to hold an anti-government rally at around noon on Saturday.</p>
<p>A reporter in the southern town of Gjirokaster, 230 km (145 miles) south of Tirana, where students have also staged a hunger strike in solidarity with Vlore, said police had been put on alert there.</p>
