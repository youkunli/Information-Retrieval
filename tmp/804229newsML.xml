<p>Elvis Presley's fans, at least 30,000 of them, filed past the rock king's grave for 10 hours into the morning on Saturday in an unprecedented outpouring on the 20th anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>Officials at Presley's Graceland mansion had to extend the the vigil by more than two hours to accommodate those who were still in line at daybreak.</p>
<p>When the wrought iron, music-noted gates to the grounds finally closed, the silent, candle-carrying pilgrims had heaped a 4-foot (1.2 metre) high mound of flowers, toy teddy bears and mementoes on his grave.</p>
<p>&quot;So many people came from so very far away. That was awesome. So many different languages,&quot; said a woman from Houston who gave her name only as Gail.</p>
<p>A member of the Elvis Country Fan Club, she was part of an honor guard that stood all night long with other fan club presidents from around the world on the lane leading from the street up the hill to the mansion-side graveyard.</p>
<p>Todd Morgan, director of creative services for Elvis Presley Enterprises, told the crowd as the vigil began that they were the largest assembly ever to show up for what has become an annual event.</p>
<p>&quot;Elvis is a bigger star than he ever, ever was,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Saturday's Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper said of the tribute:</p>
<p>&quot;They love him tender. They love him sweet. And because he said so, they haven't let him go ... Like George Washington and Jesus Christ, Elvis looms larger now than he ever did in life.&quot;</p>
<p>In the tiny plot next to the mansion's swimming pool where Presley, his parents and his paternal grandmother are laid to rest under inscribed bronze tablets, the steamy Tennessee dawn revealed evidence of the night-long tribute.</p>
<p>Candles, some dripping wax, others in glass jars, burned at the base of a nearby tableau of Christ crucified flanked by two kneeling angels in white marble.</p>
<p>There were cards, notes, baskets of fresh flowers and sprays of plastic ones. Many dropped a single rose or two as they passed the graves.</p>
<p>An orange placard signed by one Nancy Falcon read: &quot;Elvis, your beautiful voice echoes gently on my mind. Your soft blue eyes enter my soul like a summer breeze.&quot;</p>
<p>Some had stood in line for 24 hours to be among the first to walk up the hill to the white-columned mansion, circle the graveyard and return to the street -- a 10-minute stroll. Police said 30,000 people were outside Graceland when the vigil began at dusk on Friday and many more arrived during the night.</p>
<p>The vigil, followed by a concert on Saturday night, were the last major events in a weeklong observance marking the two decades since Presley's death on Aug. 16, 1977.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the 42-year-old Presley stayed up all night, finishing a racquetball game with a cousin at dawn. He was scheduled to begin a concert tour the next night and retired to his bedroom and told a companion he was going into the bathroom to read.</p>
<p>She told reporters she found him dead in the bathroom early in the afternoon of Aug. 16, a death later ascribed to a drug-induced heart attack.</p>
<p>But from death Presley and his music drew new life.</p>
<p>At this year's vigil fans from around the world stood side-by side, singing along with Elvis recordings broadcast over loudspeakers.</p>
<p>The fans were of all ages and mostly white -- couples in their 50s and grandmotherly looking women standing shoulder-to-shoulder with youngsters.</p>
<p>Sylvia Gibson of Miami, head of a Florida fan club, has kept the same vigil for 19 years. The first year after Presley's death, she said, it was an impromptu candle-lit gathering on the lawn.</p>
<p>&quot;They never write about all the good Elvis did -- his charities. He paid people's mortgages,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>During a 40-minute ceremony before fans began their trek to the Presley grave, the hot and humid night air was saturated with the voice of Elvis, singing the old spiritual &quot;Farther Along&quot; and other songs. During a moment of silent prayer there was only the voice of the insects in the tall ash trees on the mansion's lawn.</p>
<p>When the preliminaries closed with &quot;I Can't Help Falling in Love with You&quot; the crowd took up the song in full, swaying and lifting lighted candles into the night. Some locked hands and held them high; others wept.</p>
