<p>Cambodian police are holding a middle-aged Frenchman suspected of child sex offences, a top officer said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police General Skadavy M. Ly Roun of the Cambodia Interpol office said the 53-year-old photographer, named as Henion Amede, had been arrested at his Phnom Penh apartment on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We arrested three children with him under 15 years of age,&quot; said the general.</p>
<p>Amede had been charged with rape, child prostitution and child molestation and faced a prison term of up to 20 years if convicted, he added.</p>
<p>The general said the suspect was being held at his office and had been arrested after being under surveillance for a week. He had been living in Cambodia since 1995.</p>
<p>The Frenchman was believed to be the third foreigner arrested in Cambodia for child sex offences since mid-1995. An Austrian was fined and deported while a British doctor was fined and jailed for five months after he was convicted in October 1995.</p>
<p>Child welfare groups have long warned that Cambodia was becoming a haven for local and foreign paedophiles.</p>
