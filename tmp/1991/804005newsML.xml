<p>Karrie Webb blew the field away with a near-record third round 63 to open a 10-shot lead in the British Women's Open at Sunningdale on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Australian, who won the title at Woburn two years ago, finished on 198 - a championship and European Tour record for 54 holes - 18 under par and 10 clear of second-placed American Rosie Jones, who shot 66.</p>
<p>Scotland's Catriona Matthew and England's Lisa Hackney were another four shots back in joint third place on six under 210.</p>
<p>World number two Webb, from Ayr in Queensland, had six birdies and two eagles in a career best nine-under-par round that was just one outside the women's world record of 62.</p>
<p>But Webb is taking nothing for granted.  &quot;Tomorrow I still have to focus on the job in hand. I've proved that you can shoot low numbers, and anything is still possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Webb holed from 12 feet for an eagle three at the 478-yard second and had birdies at the fourth, seventh and ninth to turn in 31, five under par. She started for home with three straight birdies before dropping her only shot at the 13th - her second bogey of the championship.</p>
<p>But she chipped in for eagle at the 503-yard 14th and parred in for the 63.</p>
<p>Jones, a Solheim Cup player, had six birdies in equal halves of 33 without dropping a shot.</p>
<p>&quot;Karrie's performance was phenomenal,&quot; Jones said. &quot;I can't believe I shot six under and lost three shots.&quot;</p>
<p>World number one Annika Sorenstam shot a 69 to finish on five under beside American Betsy King and two Britons, Kathryn Marshall and Helen Dobson.</p>
