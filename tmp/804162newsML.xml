<p>Indonesia's President Suharto said on Saturday that the country's tight monetary and fiscal policies would continue in the wake of the upheavals in its rupiah currency.</p>
<p>&quot;The relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies will be maintained until the market situation is calm again and the exchange rate becomes relatively stable at a new level of equilibrium,&quot; he said during a state-of-the-nation address on the eve of Indonesia's 52nd anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>He added that the upheavals in the rupiah, which sank to a historic low of 2,960 against the dollar on Friday, one day after it was floated, were temporary.  </p>
<p>&quot;With the appropriate policy and the calmness of domestic players, the exchange rate will find a new equilibrium in line with prevailing economic fundamentals,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The rupiah has shed some 20 percent against the dollar from the beginning of the year, mostly in recent weeks. The currency has been under pressure along with other South East Asian currencies since the Thai baht crisis started in May.  </p>
<p>Suharto said that domestic businesses should be prudent in seeking loans and consider other ways of funding expansion programmes because of the plunge in the rupiah.</p>
<p>&quot;All parties concerned are reminded by recent events to act prudently in borrowing, in order not to rely excessively on loans to finance their business and to seek safer and steadier ways of funding,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said that the recent weakness in the rupiah had made foreign loans more expensive and had serious implications for business in general.  </p>
<p>&quot;The business community is demanded to seriously take into account the risk of currency fluctuation in business operations and project implementation,&quot; Suharto said in a nationally televised speech.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to get used to protecting themselves from this currency risk.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that the business community and the government should carefully make their choice on projects and activities that should be given priority and those which should be temporarily postponed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything must be in accordance with the national priority scale and based on the consideration of the current upheavals confronting Indonesia's economy.&quot;</p>
<p>Economists have said the weakness could have a sharp impact on many Indonesian companies, which have unhedged foreign currency loans.</p>
