<p>Demonstrators carrying saucepans, balloons and maracas marched on El Salvador's parliament on Friday to demand the return of savings they lost in a multi-million dollar financial swindle.</p>
<p>El Salvador authorities are investigating one of the biggest financial frauds in the country's history, after thousands of savers lost a total of more than 1 billion colones ($114 million) when top executives allegedly siphoned off funds from their investment accounts.</p>
<p>Demonstrators descended on foot and by car on El Salvador's central bank and congressional buildings, carrying banners reading, &quot;Solutions now&quot; and &quot;Mr President, paying us is in your hands&quot;.</p>
<p>Opposition deputy Ruben Zamora promised a meeting with representatives of the protestors and assured them that the authorities were looking for means to reimburse them.</p>
<p>&quot;We are discussing ways in which the state can take money from the companies connected to the fraud so it can be used to pay the investors back,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A legislative commission and the superintendent of El Salvador's financial system, Francisco Bertrand, are meeting on Saturday and will visit Ilobasco prison northeast of the capital to see top businessman Mario Galdamez, whose firms are linked to the multi-million dollar swindle.</p>
<p>Five directors of the financial firms Finespro and Insepro also stand accused, including their president Roberto Mathies Hill who is also behind bars.</p>
<p>This week authorities in El Salvador announced they had frozen the companies' assets, as well as those of at lease 40 people linked to the scam.</p>
<p>Although they were not sure of the exact size of the fraud, the authorities said it could be as large as 1.5 billion colones ($170 million).</p>
