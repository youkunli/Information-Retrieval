<headline>UK to stop funding sheep cloning project - paper.</headline>

<p>Britain's Agriculture Ministry is to stop funding the project that produced Dolly, the first cloned sheep, the Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ian Wilmut and colleagues at Scotland's Roslin Institute and biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics caused a global uproar when they announced they had cloned a sheep -- the first time an adult animal had been successfully cloned.</p>
<p>But the paper said that ministry funding, currently 252,000 pounds ($410,000), would be halved next month and withdrawn in April of next year.</p>
<p>The team that made the cloning breakthrough at Scotland's Roslin Institute learned the funding news in a letter from the ministry on Thursday. A spokeswoman for the institute confirmed the funding story but would not comment further.</p>
<p>The Telegraph quoted a ministry spokeswoman as saying: &quot;If they have researched what they were supposed to have researched, then that's it. The funding will come to an end.&quot;</p>
<p>The institute's director Grahame Bulfield said he had been warned of cuts last November yet remained shocked at the news.</p>
<p>&quot;I will move heaven and earth to keep resources in that cloning programme,&quot; he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The cloning team was said to be despondent, fearing redundancies and scientists being poached by rival teams from abroad as they seek to catch up, notably in Australia.</p>
<p>One Edinburgh scientist speculated that the government was made so uncomfortable by the cloning debate that it decided to axe much of the biotechnology research at Roslin. The patents for the cloning technology, however, are held by Roslin.</p>
<p>Following news of the breakthrough, government ministers across Europe raced to ease public concern, promising thorough checks on scientists and bans on carbon-copy humans.</p>
<p>But newspapers invoked images of &quot;master races&quot; and movie stars on production lines, while politicians demanded speedy investigations of just what genetic researchers are doing.</p>
