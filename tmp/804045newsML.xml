<p>Diego Maradona said on Saturday he had no chance of playing for Argentina in France next year in what would have been his fifth World Cup finals.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't have hopes of playing in the World Cup in France,&quot; said the 36-year-old midfield star, who is still worshipped in Argentina despite regular scandals and problems with drugs. He was speaking at a conference entitled &quot;Diego by Diego&quot; in the seaside city of Mar del Plata.</p>
<p>Maradona captained Argentina to World Cup victory in 1986 and to the final against Germany in 1990 but was expelled from the 1994 tournament in the United States after he tested positive for a banned stimulant.</p>
<p>He has made many comebacks but most have petered out quickly. His latest began a few weeks ago when he took the field for his beloved Boca Juniors, the team which represents one of the rougher areas of Buenos Aires, and he is now in training for the new Apertura league season.</p>
<p>But Maradona, who previously said he might return to play for Argentina when the national team was performing badly, said he had no ambitions beyond leading Boca to champion status.</p>
<p>&quot;Although I know it depends a lot on how I go in the Apertura tournament, it isn't something I'm losing any sleep over,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Argentine national team, who for a while performed so badly in the World Cup qualifying round they looked as if they needed even an aged Maradona, have now regained some composure and, leading the South American qualifying group, are almost assured of making it to France.</p>
