<p>The number of AIDS deaths fell last year in France for the first time since the start of the epidemic, tracking a trend in the United States, the French daily Liberation reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>French health officials planned to issue a report on Monday citing a 25 percent drop in deaths during 1996 compared to year-earlier figures, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The number of new AIDS cases also fell during the year, declining to about a thousand during the second half of the year compared to 1,228 during the first six months of 1996, it said.</p>
<p>French health officials attributed the decline to improved drugs and preventive programmes, as in the United States, where health officials this week reported a similar trend.</p>
<p>U.S. AIDS deaths fell 13 percent during the first half of 1996, the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.</p>
<p>The disease was first detected in the United States in 1981.</p>
<p>France is the European nation hardest hit by the epidemic, with 50,000 reported cases, 30,000 deaths and 110,000 people who have tested positive for AIDS virus infection, the government announced earlier this month.</p>
