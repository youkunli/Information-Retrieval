<p>A Palestinian court sentenced two Palestinians to life in jail on Saturday for the murder of an Israeli taxi driver just hours after his battered body was found in a well in the West Bank town of Jericho.</p>
<p>Jericho security court chief Ummayyad Tahboub said two men were given a life sentence with hard labour and a third, aged 17, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>The killing was said to be not politically motivated.</p>
<p>Israeli police praised the &quot;full security cooperation&quot; from their Palestinian counterparts which led to the swift justice meted out to the three men for the murder of 45-year-old Shmuel Ben-Baruch, who went missing on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The two men sentenced to life were named as Abdel Nasser Mohammad Rizeq, 20, and Ala Jibril al-Damanhouri, 19. The 17-year-old was named as Iyad Mohyammad Ahmad Abu Shabab.</p>
<p>Ben-Baruch's body was found in the five-metre (17-feet) deep well at 1:30 a.m. (2230 gmt) on Saturday. Palestinian police said he had been smashed in the head with a stone and stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem-based driver's bloodstained taxi had been found earlier in a dry riverbed in Aqabat Jabr refugee camp on the outskirts of Jericho.</p>
<p>Israeli police said the Mercedes taxi had been sold for 7,000 shekels ($2,000) to a man who used the riverbed as a storehouse for stolen vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;In this case I must say there is very good cooperation in the field despite the tensions between the (Palestinian) Authority and the (Israeli) state,&quot; Israel's Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;In this instance it seems to me it is easier to cooperate because here we are talking about -- as it appears now -- car thieves who were motivated by money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Palestinian police said the three convicted men did not belong to any political organisation.</p>
<p>Israeli-Palestinian tension has been running high since a double suicide bombing killed 16 people, including the attackers, at a market in Jerusalem on July 30.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Dennis Ross shuttled between Israeli and Palestinian leaders earlier this week in an effort to restore security cooperation and crack down on militants after the bombing.</p>
<p>Israel has imposed a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, barring tens of thousands of Palestinians from entering the Jewish state. Kahalani said Ben-Baruch's abduction and murder proved the closure was not hermetic.</p>
