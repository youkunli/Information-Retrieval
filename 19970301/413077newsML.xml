<p>A U.N. envoy said on Saturday the humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire could match that following the 1994 ethnic massacres in Rwanda and called for a ceasefire to enable aid groups to assess the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;It could even be of the magnitude of Rwanda in 1994,&quot; United Nations special envoy Mohammed Sahnoun said after briefing U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his efforts to obtain a ceasefire in the fighting following a rebel uprising in Zaire.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are doing is trying to underline the need for a cessation of hostilities,&quot; Sahnoun told reporters. &quot;The people who are on the front line need our help, need our assistance, and we cannot have access to them unless there is a cessation of hostilities.&quot;</p>
<p>An estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and allied Hutus were slaughtered in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, triggered by the death in a plane crash of the country's Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of refugees have been caught up in the fighting in eastern Zaire which began in October between Zairean government troops and rebel forces.</p>
<p>There have been eyewitness reports of massacres in eastern Zaire, but international organisations say they are unable to verify them because of the fighting in the area.</p>
<p>The United Nations refugee agency said it had evacuated all foreign aid workers from the key eastern Zaire town of Kisangani on Saturday due to growing insecurity caused by the advance of rebel troops.</p>
<p>Sahnoun is part of a broad international initiative aimed at achieving a ceasefire in Zaire. He was in South Africa earlier this week where President Nelson Mandela sought to mediate in separate meetings with representatives of the warring factions.</p>
<p>The U.N. envoy said a cease-fire would enable international organisations to provide food and medical help for stranded refugees and help determine whether massacres had taken place, as reported by eyewitnesses.</p>
<p>Annan, in Paris to meet French officials on a broad range of U.N.-related matters, said on Friday that sending a multinational force to Zaire remained an option for the international community.</p>
<p>Sahnoun said he had discussed with Annan the possibility of sending such a force into the area, but added that the move not being actively considered at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, we discussed it,&quot; Sahnoun told reporters. &quot;We don't rule it out...If there is no other alternative, if people don't heed our calls then of course the Security Council will address the situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Annan had said he believed the diplomatic initative was &quot;on the right path&quot;.</p>
