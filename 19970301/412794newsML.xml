<p>Tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees are on the move again in eastern Zaire, fleeing advancing Tutsi-led rebels, and foreign aid workers voiced fears for their fate.</p>
<p>The aid workers, who pulled out of Zaire's third city of Kisangani for security reasons, said refugees started leaving Tingi Tingi camp to the south on Friday.</p>
<p>An estimated 170,000 Hutus had set up makeshift homes in Tingi Tingi, 200 km (125 miles) south of Kisangani, after fleeing camps further to the east. Doctors say up to 40 refugees a day are dying from hunger or disease.</p>
<p>Some of the 57 aid workers who arrived in Zaire's  capital Kinshasa said Zairean soldiers and their Rwandan Hutu militia allies in the area were retreating.</p>
<p>Most of the refugees escaped from Rwanda in 1994 fearing reprisals after the genocide there of minority Tutsis by hardline Hutus, who have now joined forces with the Zairean army.</p>
<p>&quot;I appeal once again to the combatants to spare the refugees, the women and the children who have already suffered so much,&quot; U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said in a statement faxed to Reuters in Nairobi.</p>
<p>&quot;Since November we have been practically chasing refugees from one encampment to another trying to give them assistance as confrontation lines shift,&quot; added Ogata, who visited Tingi Tingi in February.</p>
<p>Doctors from the French charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said after leaving Tingi Tingi that thousands of weak and hungry refugees had been treated there or in emergency nutrition centres, adding that their lives could now be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Ogata said: &quot;We would like to continue to deliver much-needed relief to the refugees. Unfortunately, we will not be able to do so unless humanitarian workers are allowed to operate in safety.&quot;</p>
<p>The evacuated aid workers said Kisangani, on the Zaire River and headquarters for Zairean army operations in the war zone, was calm on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Tutsi-led rebels, who have won control of several towns in eastern Zaire since last October, responded to a January 20 counter-offensive by attacking on several fronts, throwing the notoriously ill-disciplined army on the defensive.</p>
<p>Zaire's Defence Ministry said government troops still controlled Kindu, a regional transport hub and army operational base further south, but independent sources said it appeared to have fallen to rebels on Friday.</p>
<p>Kindu is about 400 km (250 miles) south of Kisangani, which the rebels have identified as a target.</p>
