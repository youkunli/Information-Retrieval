<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodian forces close in on border town.</title>
<headline>Cambodian forces close in on border town.</headline>

<p>Cambodian government forces on Saturday closed to within four to five km (two miles) of the border town where forces loyal to ousted co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh were making a last stand, a senior official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't taken O'Smach yet, but we are optimistic we will take it by tomorrow,&quot; General Meas Sophea, who heads fighting operations for the government, told Reuters in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>But in Siem Reap, a provincial capital about 100 km (60 miles) south of the front lines, incoming wounded from the government side said they had taken O'Smach in the early morning hours without resistance.</p>
<p>Senior commanders could not confirm that report, and Thai authorities near the Cambodian border said O'Smach, which is in northwestern Cambodia near the Thai border, was still held by royalist troops.</p>
<p>Ten government soldiers who said they were wounded by landmines in O'Smach were taken off of helicopters for treatment in Siem Reap.</p>
<p>In addition, a senior government army commander was wounded by artillery and three government soldiers had been killed, military officials said.</p>
<p>There was no information available on royalist casualties.</p>
<p>Several hundred government troops under the control of powerful Second Prime Minister Hun Sen have been closing in on O'Smach to finish off Ranariddh's ragged army.</p>
<p>But their progress has been severely hampered by destroyed bridges, homemade landmines and thick jungle, military officials said.</p>
<p>Ranariddh, Hun Sen's former partner in a shaky coalition government since 1993, was ousted by Hun Sen on July 6 after two days of fighting in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>The royalists have continued to fight Hun Sen from a shrinking pocket of territory in the northwest, and some troops said they have been fighting with assistance from the Khmer Rouge rebels.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge said on Friday they had formed a military alliance with royalist forces in fighting against Hun Sen, but Ranariddh denied the report.</p>
<p>Some 15,000 civilians in the O'Smach area have been preparing to take refuge in Thailand and would be allowed to cross when the situation warranted it, Thai authorities have said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) called for an immediate ceasefire in Cambodia, which it called the first priority for the country.</p>
<p>But both sides seem to have ignored the call, and Ranariddh on Friday told Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn that he would not call a unilateral ceasefire and that he and Hun Sen should meet first.</p>
