<title>ISRAEL: Gaza $100 million business complex launched.</title>

<p>Construction of a $100 million business complex in Palestinian Gaza City, including a Marriott hotel, was launched at an official ceremony on Saturday.</p>
<p>Organisers said the complex, including an office building, a convention centre, restaurants, a health club and a parking lot as well as the five-star hotel, was the first major foreign investment in the Palestinian-ruled area.</p>
<p>The project is owned jointly by the Virginia, U.S.-based General Resources Design Group (GRDG), the Qatarian Salam International Investments and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>GRDG president Ziad Karram said the private sector investment in the facility represented a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; in the peace process. He said the project would boost tourism and business.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, critical business and communication services are hard to come by in Gaza. Western businesses will not come to Gaza unless we can assure them that the business services necessary to compete in the region are accessible,&quot; Karram said in a press release.</p>
<p>The centre will have its own infrastructure, including an independent power plant, waste water treatment facilities and a telecommunications centre that will serve the general public.</p>
<p>The centre is going to be dedicated to late U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who helped negotiate the project.</p>
<p>The project is expected to employ over 2,000 people during construction, provide 600 permanent jobs, another 4,000 jobs in related businesses, and inject more than $50 million into the Gaza economy annually, organisers said.</p>
