<p>Sudan's parliament speaker has ruled out any negotiations before all areas under rebel control in eastern and southern Sudan are liberated, the government owned Al-Ingaz Al-Watani newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sudan has accused Eritrea and Ethiopia of direct involvement in rebel attacks that gained momentum in January in Sudan's east and south. The two countries deny the charge.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted speaker Hassan al-Turabi as telling worshippers during Friday prayers at Khartoum University that peace talks must wait until all captured areas are regained.</p>
<p>&quot;Sudan seeks to achieve an honourable peace without weakness or preconditions and now efforts are being exerted to return all land occupied in the east and pockets in the south. We rule out dialogue until the liberation of the land occupied by foreign forces,&quot; Turabi said.</p>
<p>&quot;The aggression has united the internal front and increased its cohesion despite the harsh economic situation which the country is passing through,&quot; Turabi said.</p>
