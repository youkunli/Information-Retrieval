<p>Anti-government protesters cut off the road to the main town in southern Albania on Saturday after bloody armed clashes in the port of Vlore.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the protesters had hauled three huge tree trunks across the road outside the village of Pitsari, about 20 km (12 miles) north of Gjirokaster, blocking all traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;We will stay here all night and for as long as it takes,&quot; said Zaho Zilfo, the former local leader of President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want the party title any longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Motorists had to abandon their cars and continue on foot or turn back at the blockade, where the protesters sipped beer and lit small fires to keep warm.</p>
<p>Zilfo said police had come to the blockade earlier in the day but took no action to free the route, which links Gjirokaster with the north and the capital Tirana.</p>
<p>The blockade was one of at least six thrown up by protesters along the route south from Tirana after a fierce gun battle between civilians and impoverished Albania's Shik secret police in Vlore on Friday night.</p>
<p>Up to nine people, three of them civilians, were reported killed in the southern Adriatic port, the worst confrontation since the collapse in January of dubious pyramid investment schemes left thousands of people penniless.</p>
<p>Albanians have turned their anger on Berisha and the government for failing to control the get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>In Gjirokaster, police stood by outside the university where 46 students entered the third day of a hunger strike in solidarity with fellow students fasting in Vlore in a campaign for the government's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;We are with Vlore. You are not alone. We love you and we are proud of you,&quot; read a banner hanging from the blackboard of a classroom. The students lay on desks under blankets and watched the news on a private Greek television channel.</p>
<p>&quot;The state television is all lies,&quot; said Shkelqim Mecoriapaz, one of the student leaders. &quot;We watch Greek television and listen to the BBC and Deutsche Welle to learn the truth of the horrible things happening in our country.&quot;</p>
<p>Another student, Vasil Ilirjam, said the hunger strikers did not believe police would storm the university.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that police have understood the people's wrath...Berisha has one front open in Vlore and he can't afford another in Gjirokaster,&quot; Ilirjam said.</p>
<p>Students jeered Berisha when he visited Gjirokaster on Wednesday for his refusal to sack the government of Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi.</p>
<p>In the town, talk in cafes and on the streets was dominated by the violence in Vlore. State clerks, housewives and even some policemen were seen listening to news from foreign broadcasters on short wave radios.</p>
<p>&quot;I have two brothers in Vlore,&quot; said one woman who asked not to be identified. &quot;They both lost money and are out on the streets. I am very worried because the phones don't work and I can't get in touch with them.&quot;</p>
