<p>Little-known teenager Marlene Weingaertner pulled off a surprise victory on her debut to keep Germany in contention in their Fed Cup clash with the Czech Republic on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old Weingaertner beat Ludmila Richterova 3-6 7-5 6-3 in the opening singles of the world group one tie.</p>
<p>Although the Czechs levelled to 1-1 when Adriana Gersi defeated Barbara Rittner 6-4 6-2 in the second singles, the Germans were expecting to struggle against the powerful Czechs without the injured Steffi Graf and Anke Huber.</p>
<p>The Germans' chances of putting up a fight were helped by the late withdrawal from Saturday's singles of leading Czech player Jana Novotna, who is suffering with shingles.</p>
<p>She is still hoping to play in Sunday's doubles which could turn out to be decisive.</p>
<p>Weingaertner's performance has given the home side an extra boost, nevertheless.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what to say,&quot; she said. &quot;I was very nervous at the start but the crowd really gave me a lift.&quot;</p>
