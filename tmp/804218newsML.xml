<headline>GM, UAW reach tentative pact at parts plants.</headline>

<p>General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union agreed on a tentative contract early Saturday morning for two Michigan transmission plants, averting a potentially disastrous strike.</p>
<p>Terms of the new three-year deal with UAW Local 735 were not released. The 5,320 hourly employees covered by the pact work at GM's Powertrain Willow Run Transmission plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., and a smaller facility in Romulus, Mich.</p>
<p>Union bargainers, who were pressing for GM to add more workers and limit outsourcing, were happy with the results, a union spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The union is pleased,&quot; said Debbie Chamberlain, recording secretary.</p>
<p>She said a ratification date has not been set, and will be at least a week away. Production at the plants will continue as normal, she said.</p>
<p>GM spokesman Charles Licari said the pact, reached about 2:20 a.m. EDT (0620 GMT) eets the needs of its workers and allows the company to remain competitive.</p>
<p>The plants make transmissions and related components for many of GM's front-wheel drive and rear-wheel drive cars and trucks. Because they supply both assembly and other parts operations in the U.S. and Canada, a strike could have quickly rippled through the rest of GM's North American manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>After months of contentious labor negotiations and six strikes, it was the second time in a week that GM reached a new local agreement without a work stoppage.</p>
<p>Early Saturday Aug. 9 the two sides settled on a contract for 3,600 workers at the automaker's Cadillac assembly plant in the Detroit community of Hamtramck. Union officials have said that deal called for GM to add 400 new workers.</p>
<p>Local 735 leaders had wanted GM to add more workers to replace those who have retired and cut down on overtime. They also asked the automaker to settle health and safety issues and limit the amount of work it sends to outside contractors.</p>
<p>GM has been on a mission to make its manufacturing operations more efficient and has adopted a hard line against adding staff, preferring to let its hourly workforce shrink through attrition.</p>
<p>Union leaders, who say their members are overworked, have resisted those efforts. The clash has led to six strikes since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Strike deadlines have been set by the UAW on an almost weekly basis during the last month as it struggles to get contracts for the remaining six of its 105 GM locals. A new national pact was signed last November.</p>
<p>In July, GM and the UAW agreed on a new contract for its workers at a Warren, Mich., transmission plant after a three-day strike. That walkout idled 17,000 workers and six car assembly plants before the new pact was reached.</p>
<p>Among the locals that do not yet have new agreements is one in Dayton, Ohio, which represents workers at two brake plants. Those workers struck the company in March 1996 in a 17-day walkout that forced GM to suspend operations at 26 of its 29 North American assembly plants.</p>
<p>Two strikes earlier this year cut GM's second quarter profits by $490 million. In 1996, GM lost $1.2 billion in earnings because of work stoppages in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
