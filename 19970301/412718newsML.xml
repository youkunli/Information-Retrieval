<headline>NBA-BULL NOTCH 50TH WIN WITH FURIOUS FIRST HALF.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Chicago Bulls became the first NBA team to reach the 50-win plateau on Friday, venting their frustration over Thursday's loss in a big way.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen each scored 23 points in a sensational first-half and the Bulls cruised to a 126-108 thumping of the Sacramento Kings.</p>
<p>The Bulls, held to 70 total points in a loss at Cleveland Thursday, responded by punishing Sacramento in building a 72-42 halftime lead.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to extend my thanks to the Cavaliers for putting us in a jam tonight,&quot; Kings coach Garry St. Jean said. &quot;I haven't seen a better half played by anybody this season.</p>
<p>&quot;My hat is off to them. They're the best in the business.&quot;</p>
<p>Jordan, who was 9-for-12 in the first half, finished with 35 points. Pippen, who sat out the fourth quarter, had 29.</p>
<p>&quot;Scottie set the tone for us tonight,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;When he gets hot like that I can sneak in and out, and when we're both hitting on offence, we're a tough team to beat.&quot;</p>
<p>In Orlando, Richie Adubato had the interim removed from his head coach title and his Orlando Magic showed the reward was justified by improving to 6-0 under their new leader.</p>
<p>Penny Hardaway had 20 points and eight assists and Gerald Wilkins scored 16 points as the Magic rolled to a 94-73 rout of the struggling San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>Dominique Wilkins scored 19 points to lead the Spurs, who suffered their 43rd loss.</p>
<p>&quot;Gerard Wilkins was great off the bench tonight,&quot; said Adubato. &quot;I think he had a little incentive playing against his big brother. They were really going at each other.&quot;</p>
<p>In Boston, Grant Hill scored seven of his 29 points in overtime and posted his fourth triple-double of the month as the Detroit Pistons handed the Celtics their 12th straight loss, 106-100.</p>
<p>The victory was the eighth in nine games for the Pistons, who forced overtime when Lindsey Hunter tipped in an alley-oop inbounds pass from Hill at the buzzer.</p>
<p>Hill had his sixth triple double of the season, finishing with 12 rebounds and 12 assists to go with his 29 points.</p>
<p>At Indiana, Rik Smits scored 21 points and Mark Jackson dished out a club-record 19 assists as the Pacers beat the Milwaukee Bucks 104-85.</p>
<p>Reggie Miller added 20 points and Dale Davis had 16 and 11 rebounds for Indiana. Glenn Robinson scored 20 points and Ray Allen had 16 for Milwaukee.</p>
<p>In Miami, Gary Payton had 27 points and 11 assists and Hersey Hawkins made four free throws in the final six seconds as the Seattle SuperSonics edged the Heat 96-95 for their 40th win of the season.</p>
<p>Shawn Kemp contributed 26 points and 11 rebounds and Hawkins finished with 22 points for Seattle, which won for the eighth time in nine games.</p>
<p>Tim Hardaway had 29 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds and Voshon Lenard scored 20 points for Miami.</p>
<p>In Denver, John Starks scored seven of his 23 points in overtime and Patrick Ewing finished with 22 and 12 rebounds as the New York Knicks beat the Nuggets 112-108 to move within a half game of first-place Miami in the Atlanta Division.</p>
<p>Charles Oakley had 10 points, 18 rebounds and eight assists and Larry Johnson scored 21 points for New York.</p>
<p>Antonio McDyess scored 32 points and Ellis added 29 for Denver, which ralled from a 91-85 deficit with three minutes left in regulation to take the lead. A pair of Ewing free throws with 15 seconds left sent the game to overtime.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, Dikembe Mutombo had 27 points and 14 rebounds and Mookie Blaylock also scored 27 points to lead the Atlanta Hawks to an 86-75 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>Mutombo had 14 points and six rebounds in the third quarter, which opened with a 10-1 Hawks burst. He also had four blocked shots.</p>
<p>Steve Smith added 17 points for the Hawks, who improved to 24-3 at home.</p>
<p>At New Jersey, Latrell Sprewell shook off a sprained ankle to score 37 points in leading the Golden State Warriors to a 117-108 victory over the Nets.</p>
<p>Joe Smith added 20 points and Todd Fuller chipped in 18 for the Warriors.</p>
<p>Kendall Gill scored 30 for the Nets, who were denied a chance to win three in a row for the first time this season.</p>
<p>In Portland, Kenny Anderson had 30 points and 12 assists and Isaiah Rider added 26 points to lead the Trail Blazers to a 115-105 victory over the Utah Jazz.</p>
<p>Clifford Robinson and Rasheed Wallace chipped 20 points apiece for Portland, which ended a three-game slide.</p>

<p>In Vancouver, Jerry Stackhouse scored 25 points to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 104-100 victory over the Grizzlies in a matchup of the NBA's worst teams.</p>
<p>Clarence Weatherspoon added 20 points and Derrick Coleman chipped in 19 for Philadelphia. Bryant Reeves led Vancouver with 26 points.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, Darrick Martin scored 23 points, including three free throws in the final 26 seconds, to lift the Clippers to a 94-92 win over the Toronto Raptors.</p>
<p>Malik Sealy added 22 points and Loy Vaught had 18 and 11 rebounds for the Clippers, who have won four in a row to move into seventh place in the Western Confernce playoff race.</p>
<p>Damon Stoudamire scored 22 points, but only five in the second half to pace the Raptors.</p>
