<headline>UK's Portillo rules out future leadership bid.</headline>

<p>Michael Portillo, a former Conservative defence decretary once tipped as a future leader of his party, says he has ruled out ever running for the post.</p>
<p>Portillo, 44, who was the darling of the right-wing on the Conservative Party, unexpectedly lost his seat in the May 1 general election which swept Labour to power for the first time in 17 years.</p>
<p>He was thus ruled out of the post-election leadership campaign which saw William Hague replace John Major at the head of the party.</p>
<p>But in an interview with The Guardian newspaper on Saturday he said he now saw his future outside politics.</p>
<p>&quot;I regard the leadership as closed forever. I got quite close to it. But the moment has passed,&quot; said Portillo, who was one of the Conservative Party's leading &quot;Eurosceptics&quot;.</p>
<p>He said he was not even thinking of standing for parliament until the next election, not due for five years time.</p>
<p>Portillo said he was instead attracted to the &quot;showmanship&quot; of a television career for the next four or five years. Last month he presented a BBC television documentary about a country house.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no point going back,&quot; he said. &quot;No point speculating on what might have been because it didn't happen. It's all history.&quot;</p>
