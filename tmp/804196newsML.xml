<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Saturday he rejected Israeli &quot;dictates&quot; he crack down on militants and called for national unity talks with domestic opponents of his peace deals with Israel.</p>
<p>An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Arafat's call for talks with militant opponents of peace was &quot;appeasement of terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We reject any dictates or any conditions,&quot; Arafat told reporters in self-ruled Nablus when asked about Netanyahu's demand he clamp down on militants after a July 30 double suicide attack in an Israeli market.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Netanyahu) should learn from others and know who the Palestinian people are. He should know who he is talking to,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Arafat's comments came just days after U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross ended a mission aimed at restoring security cooperation between Israel and the PLO after the attack which killed 16 people, including the two bombers.</p>
<p>Arafat said the peace process was at a &quot;dangerous turn&quot; and his cabinet appealed for international pressure on Israel to ease sanctions it imposed on Palestinians after the bombings.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said she will make her maiden visit to the Middle East provided there was progress in restoring Israeli-PLO security coordination.</p>
<p>The United States has also criticised Israel for maintaining a freeze on transfers of tax revenues its owes the Palestinians.</p>
<p>The Palestinian cabinet said in a statement released after its weekly meeting on Friday night that security cooperation with Israelis had resumed during Ross' visit in a trilateral forum with U.S. security officials.</p>
<p>Arafat pointed to the arrest by PLO forces on Saturday of three Palestinian car thieves who murdered an Israeli taxi driver in Jericho as proof it was working with Israeli police.</p>
<p>&quot;We implement Palestinian law but not the dictates. This is the main basis we had agreed upon with the Israelis and the Americans before,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>Israeli police praised PLO forces for apprehending the Israeli driver's killers, who received long prison terms in a hasty trial on Saturday, but Israeli officials said cooperation in a criminal case could not replace a crackdown on &quot;terror&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot compare the treatment of this matter with what Secretary of State Albright has said and what we have been stressing,&quot; Netanyahu aide David Bar-Illan told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;What is needed is a crackdown on the terrorist infrastructure. In that area the Palestinian Authority has done almost nothing,&quot; Bar-Illan said.</p>
<p>Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza and froze financial transfers it owes the Palestinian Authority under an economic protocol after the attack. Palestinians have condemned the sanctions as collective punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Israeli government says it is easing the siege measures, on the ground it is pressuring residents and cutting off their earnings,&quot; the Palestinian cabinet statement said.</p>
<p>The United States said on Friday it was disappointed at Israel's delay in releasing funds to the Authority.</p>
<p>Arafat said he would convene next week a Palestinian &quot;national unity&quot; forum to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;It was decided that next Wednesday there will be an expanded meeting of the Palestinian national movement with all its actors,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>The Palestinian leader in February held the first round of &quot;national unity&quot; talks, which included the militant Islamist group Hamas. Hamas boycotted a later round in April, saying Arafat had yet to free some of the movement's activists.</p>
<p>Hamas' armed wing claimed responsibility for last month's suicide attacks in a leaflet whose credibility has been questioned by both Israeli and Palestinian officials. The attackers have yet to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;The call to Hamas to participate in national talks does not bode well,&quot; Bar-Illan said.</p>
<p>&quot;(Arafat) has been making agreements that flirt with the terrorist organisations since the Palestinian Authority was established. We don't believe that this kind of appeasement of terrorism works,&quot; Bar-Illan said.</p>
