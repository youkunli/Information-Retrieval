<p>Two Paris-based humanitarian aid groups which withdrew from the east Zaire town of Kisangani in the face of a rebel advance accused the world on Saturday of turning its back on the refugees in the area.</p>
<p>&quot;Since last November, due to a lack of will and political cohestion among the members of the U.N. Security Council, these refugees have been totally abandoned by the international community,&quot; Action Contre la Faim (Action Against Hunger - ACF) said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The states involved in the region have been dilly-dallying for the past three months and the international community's commitment to help the refugees appears to have been only window-dressing,&quot; said Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders - MSF) in a separate statement.</p>
<p>&quot;MSF once again denounces the apathy of the U.N. member states, and once again asks for urgent measures to assure the protection of tens of thousands of refugees in distress in eastern Zaire,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>A representative of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said 57 foreign relief workers left Zaire's third city of Kisangani citing insecurity and a lack of safe conduct permits from Zaire's army.</p>
<p>The two aid groups said the withdrawal meant that more than 120,000 refugees in Tingi Tingi, the largest refugee camp left in eastern Zaire, were without assistance and vulnerable to a rebel advance.</p>
<p>They said refugees were already fleeing the camp and they predicted that many people there would die of disease or starvation.</p>
<p>Kisangani, on the Zaire River, is the headquarters for army operations in the war zone where government forces launched a counter-offensive on January 20.</p>
<p>The rebels, who took up arms in October and hold towns and territory in the east, responded by attacking on several fronts, throwing the notoriously ill-disciplined army on the defensive.</p>
