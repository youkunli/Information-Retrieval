<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng opted for caution in his first major speech since the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, vowing to tackle long-delayed state sector reform but omitting annual tributes to Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Li peppered his state of the nation address to the National People's Congress (NPC), or parliament, with references to Deng, who died last week aged 92, but failed even to mention the founder of communist China -- whose radical policies Deng spent the better part of the last 18 years battling to reverse.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a major ideological omission,&quot; said one Western diplomat. &quot;I don't think I've ever seen the premier's annual speech to the NPC fail even to pay lip service to Mao.&quot;</p>
<p>While ignoring Mao, Li stuck close to the policy directions established before Deng's death and chose the need to revitalise state-owned firms as the focus of his speech.</p>
<p>A brief moment of silence to open the 13-day annual congress and the unusually subdued colours of senior leaders' neckties marked the first session for nearly 20 years where Deng was not present or at least listed as an absentee member.</p>
<p>Li's caution was in line with predictions from analysts who expect Beijing to stress stability in the months after the passing of the 92-year-old architect of China's reform.</p>
<p>The premier painted a rosy picture of the economy and vowed to continue the transformation launched by Deng 18 years ago, but took a business-as-usual approach.</p>
<p>He placed most emphasis on long-delayed reform of the state sector, which has sunk ever deeper into inefficiency and losses since Deng abandoned Mao's strict central planning.</p>
<p>If new life was not breathed into state enterprises, two-thirds of which are in the red, China's socialist system could crumble, warned the premier.</p>
<p>&quot;Development and reform of state enterprises is a major economic problem that relates to the nation's economic development and is also a major political problem that relates to the fate of the socialist system,&quot; Li said.</p>
<p>China's 100,000-firm state sector reported a first ever net loss in the first quarter of 1996. While the figures have since recovered slightly, officials warn this remains a major burden.</p>
<p>On other thorny issues, Li stayed close to policy lines drawn long before Deng's death on February 19.</p>
<p>He took a relatively mild tone on Beijing's arch-rival Taiwan, vowing firm opposition to any moves on the island towards independence but voicing confidence that negotiations could pave the way to peaceful reunification.</p>
<p>He was upbeat on ties with the United States, rocked by disputes over Taiwan, human rights and trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Sino-U.S. relations have undergone relatively large setbacks but are now evidencing a trend towards improvement and development,&quot; Li told nearly 3,000 members of the rubber-stamp parliament in Beijing's Stalinist-era Great Hall of the People.</p>
<p>Analysts say China's leadership is likely to take a highly conservative approach to policy in 1997, which will be dominated by the return of Hong Kong from British rule on July 1 and an important Communist Party meeting in October.</p>
<p>The desire to put stability before all else in the early stages of the post-Deng era appeared to be reflected in Li's predictions for the economy.</p>
<p>He set the 1997 target for growth at 8.0 percent, a conservative figure for an economy that expanded 9.7 percent last year. State economists have forecast 10.5 percent growth.</p>
<p>The premier, who has long advocated attempts to tame China's rollercoaster economy, claimed at least temporary victory over price rises that caused widespread discontent in 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The national economy has continued to show faster growth, inflation has effectively been controlled,&quot; Li said. &quot;This is one of the outstanding features of the economy of last year.&quot;</p>
