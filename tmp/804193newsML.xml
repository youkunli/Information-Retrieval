<p>Kuwait Airways Corp (KAC) said it was still considering offers to sell its 20 percent share in the Bombay-based Jet Airways, the official Kuwait News Agency reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The offers made are being considered, so the appropriate decision can be made,&quot; the agency quoted a KAC official as saying.</p>
<p>A recent Indian measure barred foreign companies from holding stakes in domestic airlines making KAC consider offers by Jet Airways and other firms to buy its share in Jet Airways, the official said.</p>
<p>A Jet spokesman said on Tuesday his company was to buy out the 40 percent share held equally by KAC and Gulf Air in the airline's Isle of Man-registered holding company Tail Winds.</p>
<p>&quot;No agreement has been reached about the sale,&quot; said the KAC official. &quot;This issue has not been discussed with any company.&quot;</p>
<p>In June India's Civil Aviation Ministry gave KAC and Gulf Air until October 15 to sell their respective 20 percent stake in Jet Airways.</p>
<p>Jet Airways was set up in 1992 and began operations a year later. It has a fleet of 12 boeing 737s and has recently taken out dry leases on two GECAS B 737-400s which are due this month.</p>
