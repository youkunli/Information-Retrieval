<p>One person was killed and three houses set on fire in sporadic violence near the port city of Mombasa overnight, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police could not say whether the incident at Mtwapa, a village 15 kms (nine miles) northeast of Mombasa, was linked to an attack three days ago when unidentified assailants killed at least 15 people.</p>
<p>Generally, police said the situation had returned to normal and tension had eased in and around Mombasa but a manhunt for the attackers was still underway.</p>
<p>Residents, however, said they still felt insecure after Wednesday night's attack -- the latest blow to the government of President Daniel arap Moi in an election year.</p>
<p>&quot;The government appears incapable of restoring law and order and most people have fled from their homes,&quot; said Nyagah Murano, a resident in the Likoni area south of Mombasa.</p>
<p>National Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said on Friday a major security operation, involving police, army and navy units, was underway in the area.</p>
<p>Reinforcements from the crack paramilitary General Service Unit were trucked into the area, which is hilly and has caves where police thought the attackers might be hiding.</p>
<p>Several hundred frightened local residents trekked to shelter at a Roman Catholic church compound in Likoni on Friday, carrying a few belongings on their heads.</p>
<p>Kimanthi said in Nairobi that six police, five attackers and two civilians were killed during Wednesday's well-organised night-long raid on police posts in Likoni.</p>
<p>He said a seventh policeman had died on Thursday and one more civilian had died on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Those are the bodies we have in the mortuary. If there are other bodies in the bush we don't know about them,&quot; said Kimanthi, denying reports that any police had been abducted.</p>
<p>But a security officer, who declined to be identified, said at least 21 people were killed in the raid and attacks since then, and seven police including three policewomen were missing.</p>
<p>The security officer told Reuters that four dead civilians were found on Thursday night and two more near Likoni on Friday.</p>
<p>Kenya's commercial KTN television put the toll at 20 dead.</p>
<p>A total of 43 people have been arrested since the Likoni raid.</p>
<p>The search operation involving hundreds of men stretched through a tourist haven from Mombasa to the Tanzanian border, but there were no reports of casualties among the thousands of foreign tourists in the area of white coral sand beaches.</p>
<p>Hotel shuttle buses were suspended on Friday and tourists told to stay on hotel property until security was restored.</p>
<p>Scores of attackers armed with machetes seized 28 police issue G-3 rifles and two sub-machineguns on Wednesday and also burned two police posts at Likoni and freed Kenyan prisoners.</p>
<p>Several slogans painted on walls near Matuga pointed to a political motive exacerbated by tribal and land tensions.</p>
<p>&quot;These are not criminals. These are not thugs. Federalism,&quot; said one. &quot;Federalism. Mainlanders should go to their homes,&quot; said another. &quot;Federalism. Justice and Land,&quot; said a third.</p>
<p>Moi's government has been put under pressure since May by an opposition-backed alliance demanding democratic reforms before a general election this year. Police violently breaking up rallies have rattled investors and tourists.</p>
<p>Kenya's central bank appealed on Friday to foreign investors not to quit East Africa's largest market after the International Monetary Fund halted a key aid package, citing corruption.</p>
<p>Investors pulled out of Kenya's usually lucrative weekly auction of treasury bills on Thursday because of uncertainty. The row with the IMF has hit the shilling currency and jolted investors.</p>
