<p>Seven people were killed and dozens injured when police opened fire on villagers north of Dhaka over a land dispute, local officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>One police officer said more than 100 people were hurt.</p>
<p>The officials said the auxiliary police, known as Ansars, were called in on Friday to evict people occupying a vacant site.</p>
<p>&quot;The unlawful occupiers started a battle with Ansars and at one stage, reinforced by villagers, attacked them with lethal weapons,&quot; one police officer at Savar, 40 km (25 miles) from Dhaka, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ansars opened fire in self-defence. Seven people were killed and over 100 injured in clashes,&quot; he said without giving details.</p>
<p>Savar residents said on Saturday the situation was tense and villagers were regrouping for a possible backlash.</p>
