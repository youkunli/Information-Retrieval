<p>Just hours after Washington decided to certify Mexico as an ally in the drug war, authorities admitted that a top drug boss had escaped from custody while U.S. President Bill Clinton was still deliberating.</p>
<p>Humberto Garcia Abrego, who is accused of money-laundering and is the brother of jailed Mexico Gulf cartel chief Juan Garcia Abrego, walked out of installations of the National Institute for Combatting Drugs late on Thursday or early on Friday, the Attorney General's Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>A probe has been launched.</p>
<p>The escape was bound to embarrass Mexico and provide further fuel for critics of drug corruption.</p>
<p>But, in an apparent effort at damage limitation, it was announced hours after U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended an agonizing week for Mexico by saying that -- contrary to some rumours -- Washington would grant Mexico certification as part of its annual review of antinarcotics efforts by other nations.</p>
<p>Garcia's escape appeared to have coincided almost exactly with Mexico's announcement late on Thursday that it had arrested Oscar Malherbe de Leon, the acting leader of the Gulf drug cartel.</p>
<p>Malherbe's arrest -- announced more than 24 hours after he was seized, and just as Washington was in the final hours of deliberation on the certification issue -- won praise from the U.S. government and may have helped Clinton face down opponents of certifying Mexico.</p>
<p>Malherbe took over the Gulf cartel following the January 1996 arrest of its leader Juan Garcia Abrego, Humberto's brother. Juan Garcia is now serving 11 life sentences without parole in the United States after being convicted of drug-trafficking in a Houston court.</p>
<p>Humberto Garcia was initially legally released from custody just before midnight on Tuesday (0600 GMT Wednesday) after winning a court order protecting him from illegal arrest from a judge in Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>Authorities immediately took him back into custody, however, to answer a &quot;presentation order&quot; requiring him to testify about other outstanding laundering and criminal association charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Inexplicably the official in charge of the investigation told his superiors that Humberto Garcia Abrego had 'gone from the National Institute for Combatting Drugs' before the investigation was completed,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>After Washington's decision to certify Mexico was announced, the Mexican government issued a terse statement criticising the procedure as counterproductive.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico sustains that the fight against drug trafficking requires international cooperation which respects the sovereignty of each state and stronger bilateral and multilateral mechanisms so that everyone does their part against this world phenomenon,&quot; the foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico is thus committed to advancing firmly in this task at home and promoting dialogue abroad, avoiding unilateral judgments and measures which do not contribute to bolstering our ability to deal efficiently with the scourge of drugs and its effects of corruption and impunity.&quot;</p>
<p>Augusto Gomez Villanueva, president of the congressional foreign relations committee, was less circumspect, calling certification &quot;a smokescreen to hide that there are 40 million consumers of drugs in our neighbour to the north and that 80 percent of the money laundered in the world is washed there&quot;.</p>
<p>The official disdain for the certification decision belied the enormous importance of the topic to Mexico.</p>
<p>The presidency, the foreign ministry and the Mexican embassy in Washington spent the last few days in an effort to convince Americans of Mexico's achievements in the drug war.</p>
<p>But Mexican financial markets wobbled nastily in the past two days as rumours spread that Washington might this year for the first time deny Mexico its seal of drug approval.</p>
<p>On Thursday the peso tumbled by 2.2 percent against the dollar -- its biggest one-day fall since November 1995 -- and interest rates jumped as traders fretted about the possible economic impact of a decertification.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the peso fall was a decisive factor,&quot; one Mexican official told Reuters. &quot;The Americans just couldn't take the risk of doing anything which might blow the Mexican economy off course again just when it was recovering&quot; from its deepest recession in half a century.</p>
