<p>Suzuki, 25th on the Japan PGA's money rankings with one win last year, started well when his 151-yard second shot on the par-four first hole at the Golden Palm Country Club went in.</p>
<p>Suzuki followed up with eagles on the par-five fourth and seventh holes and held on for the win over Maruyama.</p>
<p>Hajime Meshiai beat defending champion Hisayuki Sasaki one-up and Kazuhiko Hosokawa, number four on the JPGA's money ranking list last year, defeated Masahiro Kuramoto two and one.</p>
<p>In Sunday's semifinals, Suzuki will be paired with Meshiai and Tanaka will take on Hosokawa.</p>
<p>The winner will advance to the final in the United States, where representatives from four regions around the world will vie for the $1 million top prize.</p>
