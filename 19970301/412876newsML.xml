<headline>Support grows for Cardoso in key Brazil city -poll.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-03-01</dateline>

<p>Support for Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's government in the key financial city of Sao Paulo is at its highest since Cardoso took office in January 1995, according to a poll published by Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper on Saturday.</p>
<p>According to a survey of 1,083 people carried out by Datafolha, 56 percent rated Cardoso's government as good or excellent. Previously, the most positive response had been in December 1995 when Cardoso's team had the backing of 46 percent.</p>
<p>During a series of polls carried out since December 1994, opposition to Cardoso has only outweighed support on one occasion, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>This was in May 1996 when 33 percent judged his government as bad or terrible against 25 percent in favor. This followed a massacre in April of 19 landless farmers in the northern state of Para, Folha said.</p>
<p>Since then, however, Cardoso's popularity has been on the rise, reaching 44 percent in December last year. Folha attributed the recent rise to the lower house's hard-fought approval of a constitutional change which gives Cardoso the right to run for a second term in 1998.</p>
<p>The amendment has to be put to the vote in the Senate where it is expected to have a smoother passage.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently his victory against the opposition in Congress fueled his image of strength and stability,&quot; the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The country's anti-inflationary plan, begun in July 1994, is also continuing to see growing support, the poll said.</p>
<p>Some 83 percent of those surveyed felt the plan was good for the country, up from 76 percent in December, while 76 percent said it was good for individuals compared with 70 percent previously.</p>
<p>As well as the country's financial center, Sao Paulo is Brazil's largest city with under 10 million citizens. Brazilian population is estimated at around 160 million.</p>
<p>The margin of error in the poll is three percentage points on either side, Folha said.</p>
