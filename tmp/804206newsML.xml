<p>A hooded gunman shot dead a Turkish Cypriot in the Cyprus coastal town of Limassol on Saturday, police said.</p>
<p>Jian Nejip Hakkemes, 38, was killed from four bullets fired at close range by a gunman in the Turkish Cypriot neighbourhood of the town at 8.40 a.m. (0540 GMT) as he was riding a motorcycle.</p>
<p>Police cordoned off the area and were conducting inquiries, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;He died instantly. We are conducting inquiries in all directions,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Hakkemes was arrested by police earlier this year on suspicion of spying on Greek Cypriot army positions, but later released for lack of evidence. Police said he was under inquiry for drugs-related offences.</p>
<p>&quot;He had enemies among both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots,&quot; the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some 300 Turkish Cypriots live in the majority Greek Cypriot populated south of Cyprus and mainly Limassol.</p>
<p>Most of Cyprus's Turkish Cypriots live in the north, which was occupied by Turkey in 1974 after a brief coup on the island engineered by the military then ruling Greece.</p>
