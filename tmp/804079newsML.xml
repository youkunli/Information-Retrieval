<p>Poland's central bank would like to see six month deposit rates in banks at 20-21 percent and credit rates proportionately higher or it may have to further tighten its monetary policy, a central bank official said.</p>
<p>Jerzy Stopyra, head of the National Bank of Poland's monetary policy department told the Rzeczpospolita daily the deposit and credit rate rises in banks following the official NBP rate rise on August 4 were not big enough.</p>
<p>&quot;What banks did, does not guarantee that credit action will diminish. In my opinion interest paid on six-month deposits should be 20-21 percent,&quot; Stopyra said.</p>
<p>Interest on six-month deposits is currently at between 17 and 20 percent in most commercial banks.</p>
<p>At the start of the month the NBP raised its discount rate by 2.5 points to 24.5 percent and its lombard rate by two points to 27 percent to curb domestic demand, fuelled by a boom in credits, and cut the trade gap through smaller imports.</p>
<p>The NBP also said that it would start collecting six month deposits from individuals offreing interest to competitive commercial banks, to make banks raise their deposit rates.</p>
<p>&quot;If banks set the six month deposit rate at 20-21 percent and proportionately raised credit rates, maybe we would not have to offer to collect deposits,&quot; Stopyra said.</p>
<p>&quot;But is banks do not raise their rates substantially, we will need to further tighten our monetary policy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The central bank has earlier said that it may further raise banks' obligatory reserves on deposits and even impose credit limits.</p>
<p>Since its official rate rise the NBP has also raised its key 14-day reverse repo rate by 0.55 point to 23.55 percent and its 91-day NBP-bill yield to 23.50 percent.</p>
<p>Banks have increased their base credit rates by an average of 1-1.5 point to around 24-25 percent after the NBP move and some have raised their deposit rates by an average of one point.</p>
