<p>Local governments owning stock in German diversified utility RWE AG said on Saturday they did not fundamentally oppose the company's plans to strip them of their multiple voting rights.</p>
<p>&quot;From our point of view there isn't a categorical 'no', but there also isn't a 'yes',&quot; Walter Mende, head of the VkA group of communal RWE shareholders, told Die Welt newspaper.</p>
<p>RWE announced this week it wanted to scrap multiple voting rights held mainly by 60 local governments which control the company despite owning only 30 percent of its equity capital.</p>
<p>The shareholding arrangement, which dates back to 1924, is seen by investors as an anachronism. RWE's announcement of the planned change sent its stock soaring 10 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mende said a decision on the shareholding change could not be expected before October, and the fate of the proposal would only be finally sealed at RWE's annual shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Under the RWE proposal, the special shares -- which each carry 20 votes -- would be converted into ordinary shares.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the number of voting shares in the company, RWE would also offer to convert preferred stock into ordinary shares and charge a premium.</p>
<p>The premium would then go to compensate the holders of the special shareholders -- many of which desperately need a cash infusion to shore up their finances.</p>
<p>Mende told Die Welt that if the communes were to give up their voting rights &quot;then we would have to talk about a fair price&quot;. He said he expected the talks to be long and difficult.</p>
<p>RWE shares closed a touch lower on Friday at 86.70 marks, while preferreds tumbled 3.45 marks to 71.25 marks.</p>
