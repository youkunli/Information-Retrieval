<title>SWITZERLAND: Ravers flock to Europe's number two techno fest.</title>
<headline>Ravers flock to Europe's number two techno fest.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-08-16</dateline>

<p>Up to half a million people were expected to swamp Zurich for the annual techno music Street Parade on Saturday, Europe's second-largest techno festival after the Berlin Love Parade.</p>
<p>Techno fans, called ravers, in flashy costumes or scantily clad for hot weather, started arriving on Friday from across Europe for the five-hour parade by 30 booming sound trucks along five km (three miles) of the city's lakefront.</p>
<p>When the parade ends on Saturday evening, ravers can choose between 30 all-night techno parties in sites ranging from the main train station to a forest clearing above the city.</p>
<p>&quot;It has all been peaceful so far,&quot; said a police spokesman in Zurich, Switzerland's biggest city with about one million inhabitants in the wider metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Techno music is a mix of thundering beats and repetitive electronic bleats supplied by disc jockeys equipped with massive sound systems.</p>
<p>Zurich's Street Parade started in 1992, three years after Berlin's Love Parade, and has grown from around 2,000 dedicated ravers the first time to a mix of dancers and spectators that last year totalled about 300,000 people.</p>
<p>Berlin's Love Parade on July 12 drew up to a million people.</p>
<p>The Zurich festival under the motto &quot;Love, peace and tolerance&quot; is also a financial wellspring, generating sales estimated at around 50 million Swiss francs ($30 million) for everything from music CDs to railroad tickets. ($ = 1.506 Swiss Francs)</p>
