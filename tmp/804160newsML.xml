<headline>Indonesia's Suharto calls for curb on borrowings.</headline>

<p>Indonesian President Suharto said on Saturday that domestic businesses should be prudent in seeking loans and consider other ways of funding expansion programmes because of the plunge in the rupiah currency.</p>
<p>&quot;All parties concerned are reminded by recent events to act prudently in borrowing, in order not to rely excessively on loans to finance their business and to seek safer and steadier ways of funding,&quot; he said during an address on the eve of Indonesia's 52nd anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>He said that the recent weakness in the rupiah had made foreign loans more expensive and had serious implications for business in general.  </p>
<p>&quot;The business community is demanded to seriously take into account the risk of currency fluctuation in business operations and project implementation,&quot; Suharto said in a nationally televised speech.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to get used to protecting themselves from this currency risk.</p>
<p>&quot;This means that the business community and the government should carefully make their choice on projects and activities that should be given priority and those which should be temporarily postponed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything must be in accordance with the national priority scale and based on the consideration of the current upheavals confronting Indonesia's economy.&quot;</p>
<p>Indonesia floated the rupiah on Thursday and the currency sank to a historic low of 2,960 against the dollar on Friday. It has fallen some 20 percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Economists have said the weakness could have a sharp impact on many Indonesian companies, which have unhedged foreign currency loans.</p>
