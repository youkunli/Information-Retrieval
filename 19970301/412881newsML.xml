<p>At least eight people were killed in northwest Colombia when gunmen of the left and right went on rampages through two small towns in a coal-mining district of Antioquia province, authorities said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police and military officials said the worst attack occurred late Friday in the municipality of Vegachi, where a group of about 20 hooded gunmen killed six people and abducted at least five others who they carried off in the back of a truck.</p>
<p>National radio reports, which could not be immediately confirmed, said as many as 12 people were dragged off by the gumen who belonged to a suspected right-wing death squad operating in the area.</p>
<p>In the nearby town of Yali, at least two people were killed and two policemen wounded in an attack on Friday by leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas, army spokesmen said.</p>
<p>The ELN, Colombia's second largest guerrilla group, was founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1966 and specialises in kidnappings and a nationwide campaign of economic sabotage.</p>
