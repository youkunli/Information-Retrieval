<p>Mexican lawmakers and officials on Friday snarled at Washington's decision to certify it as an ally in the drug war, saying the annual evaluation process was interventionist and unfair.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended an agonizing week for Mexico by announcing that -- contrary to some rumours -- Washington would grant Mexico certification despite a series of embarrassing drug corruption scandals.</p>
<p>The Mexican government delayed a reaction for several hours, cancelling a promised news conference with Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria and eventually producing a terse statement acknowledging Washington's decision.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico sustains that the fight against drug trafficking requires international cooperation which respects the sovereignty of each state and stronger bilateral and multilateral mechanisms so that everyone does their part against this world phenomenon,&quot; the foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico is thus committed to advancing firmly in this task at home and promoting dialogue abroad, avoiding unilateral judgments and measures which do not contribute to bolstering our ability to deal efficiently with the scourge of drugs and its effects of corruption and impunity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want to give this too much prominence,&quot; one government official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Augusto Gomez Villanueva, president of the congressional foreign relations committee, was less circumspect, attacking certification as &quot;a smokescreen to hide that there are 40 million consumers of drugs in our neighbour to the north and that 80 percent of the money laundered in the world is washed there&quot;.</p>
<p>The official disdain for the certification decision belied the enormous importance of the topic to Mexico.</p>
<p>The presidency, the foreign ministry and the Mexican embassy in Washington spent the last few days in an effort to convince Americans of Mexico's achievements in the drug war.</p>
<p>In Mexico, normally unavailable officials offered interviews on the successes of Mexico's drug fight and traditionally hard-to-get narcotics war data was suddenly faxed to foreign correspondents in detail.</p>
<p>Mexican authorities announced the arrest of a top drug lord on Thursday night, the eve of the certification decision. They said Oscar Malherbe was running the Mexico Gulf drug cartel, one of the country's biggest, when he was detained.</p>
<p>Malherbe had actually been seized more than 24 hours before the dramatic last-minute announcement of his arrest was made, suggesting that the timing was not coincidental.</p>
<p>Navy chiefs in the Yucatan peninsula, a key staging point in the smuggling of cocaine north to the United States, organised a burning of a big haul of drugs in front of invited reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>But Mexican financial markets wobbled nastily in the past two days as rumours spread that Washington might this year for the first time deny Mexico its seal of drug approval.</p>
<p>On Thursday the peso tumbled by 2.2 percent against the dollar -- its biggest one-day fall since November 1995 -- and interest rates jumped as traders fretted about the possible economic impact of a decertification.</p>
<p>Finance minister Guillermo Ortiz gave a veiled warning that decertification of Mexico might affect the U.S.'s billions of dollars of investments in Mexico and hurt booming bilateral trade.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the peso fall was a decisive factor,&quot; one Mexican official told Reuters. &quot;The Americans just couldn't take the risk of doing anything which might blow the Mexican economy off course again just when it was recovering&quot;.</p>
<p>Mexico has just finished paying back $12.5 billion of U.S. emergency aid to bail it out after the economy almost collapsed in the wake of a December 1994 peso devaluation.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton was expected to visit in April and Mexican officials worried that a decertification would whip up anti-American feeling ahead of the visit.</p>
