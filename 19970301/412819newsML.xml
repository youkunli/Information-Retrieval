<text>
<p>Smith Corona Corp on Friday said it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after a 20-month reorganization.</p>
<p>A federal court judge approved Smith Corona's reorganization on January 27. The plan would give the company's unsecured creditors 85 percent of its common stock and about $0.36 in cash for each dollar of allowed claims.</p>
<p>Smith Corona emerges from Chapter 11 with a new $25 million credit facility. The company's cash pool to repay some of its creditors increased by $550,000 to $1.33 million, Smith Corona said.  </p>
<p>Smith Corona, a maker of typewriters and word processors, said the increased pool followed a settlement with banks concerning its debtor-in-possession agreement and pre-petition credit arrangements.</p>
<p>Certain borrowings under the credit facility will be restricted until March 10, when the settlement with banks about certain parts of its debtor-in-possession financing become final.</p>
<p>Shareholders of record as of August 15, 1996, will receive a warrant for every 20 shares of Smith Corona stock held. The warrants will be priced at 18 months and can be exercised six months from now. The warrants expire two years from now.</p>
