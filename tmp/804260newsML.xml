<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: &quot;Significant&quot; bomb-making find in Ireland.</title>
<headline>&quot;Significant&quot; bomb-making find in Ireland.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1997-08-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>Irish police have uncovered a significant amount of bomb-making equipment in a search near the town of Cavan, on the border with Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Police said one man was arrested after the equipment was found in a search of premises near the border town but gave no further details.</p>
<p>The equipment was thought to have been gathered by an Irish repubican group fighting British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The main group, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), called a truce on July 20 but at least two other organisations with the same goal say they will continue to attack British targets.</p>
<p>The IRA is thought to have several tonnes of arms hidden in the Irish republic including semtex plastic explosive and automatic weapons.</p>
<p>It has said it will never surrender its arsenal until a lasting political settlement is agreed at peace talks to which its political wing, Sinn Fein, will be invited in September if the guerrilla truce is deemed genuine by Britain.</p>
