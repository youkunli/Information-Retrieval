<text>
<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha said on Saturday Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi's government would resign.  </p>
<p>Berisha spoke on state television after talks with opposition parties on the violent crisis racking the impoverished Balkan country following the collapse of get-rick-quick pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>&quot;To resolve the problems that have been created the leaders of the political parties...came to the conclusion that the Meksi government will resign,&quot; Berisha said.</p>
<p>He said his ruling Democratic Party could form a successor cabinet but would hold broad consultations with opposition forces.</p>
<p>Berisha's crisis talks took place after up to nine people were reported killed in a gun battle between protesters and the former Stalinist state's Shik secret police in the southern port of Vlore, the focus for anti-government resentment.</p>
