<p>Croatian striker Robert Spehar began to repay his transfer to Monaco within 48 hours of signing for the French champions and just 14 minutes into his league debut in a 3-0 win at Lyon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Spehar headed Monaco in front from a cross from the left by defender Christophe Pignol, then Nigeria's Victor Ikpeba added two second half goals, both laid on by playmaker Japhet N'Doram, as Monaco rediscovered their punch in attack.</p>
<p>It was Monaco's first win of the season after a defeat and a draw and lifted them from 17th to equal seventh in the first division on four points, five behind Paris St Germain and Metz.</p>
<p>PSG went top on goal difference as two former Lyon players they signed in the off-season, French internationals Franck Gava and Florian Maurice inspired them to a 3-1 home win over Cannes.</p>
<p>Maurice laid on the first goal for Italian striker Marco Simone and Gava scored the crucial second after Cannes equalised with Dane Brian Jensen's second penalty in three matches.</p>
<p>PSG's Brazilian captain Rai -- who like Simone and Maurice has scored twice in three league games -- scored the third goal from a penalty in the 89th minute that lifted them over Metz, 2-1 winners at Chateauroux on Friday.</p>
<p>Marseille, who did not win away at all last season, were held to a 0-0 draw at Montpellier after their promising start with two home victories. The former European champions are third with seven points.</p>
<p>Striker Stephane Guivarc'h, the division's top scorer last season, set Auxerre up for their first win of the season, 2-0 at Nantes, with a 54th minute drive from a tapped free kick by Bernard Diomede outside the box.</p>
<p>Midfielder Yann Lachuer added the second in the 70th from a Guivarc'h cross from the left.</p>
<p>&quot;In the first half, we barely held on and I even thought we might go under in the last quarter of an hour,&quot; Auxerre coach Guty Roux said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, in the second, we were better physically and Stephane Guivarc'h made the difference with a magnificent free kick.&quot;</p>
<p>Guivarc'h said: &quot;It's true my goal came at the right moment to put us back in the match.&quot;</p>
<p>Nantes defender Serge Le Dizet said: &quot;We're going to have to be morally strong to stand up to the pressure you can already hear among our fans.&quot;</p>
<p>Some 2,000 Nantes supporters demonstrated outside the club's Beaujoire stadium against the team's poor results -- three defeats and no goals scored in three games by a side that finished third last season.</p>
<p>They called for the resignation of sporting director Robert Budzynski after an off-season in which the indebted club sold key players N'Doram, Pignol and Claude Makelele, who was transferred to Marseille, with no major reinforcements.</p>
<p>There were no incidents as police dispersed the crowd.</p>
<p>Former Ajax Amsterdam midfielder Kiki Musampa marked his Bordeaux debut with a 51st-minute equaliser, three minutes after his new side had fallen behind to modest Rennes.</p>
<p>Veteran striker Jean-Pierre Papin put Bordeaux ahead in the 16th minute but Rennes fought back with goals by Loic Lambert in the 37th and Nicolas Gousse three minutes after the interval.</p>
