<p>China must remain on alert against the threat of inflation despite its achievements last year in cooling galloping price increases, Premier Li Peng said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The national economy has continued to show faster growth, inflation has effectively been controlled,&quot; Li told 2,808 deputies attending the annual session of the National People's Congress, or parliament, gathered in the Great Hall of the People.</p>
<p>After several years in which curbing inflation was Li's top priority in his annual government work report, Li told delegates that the benchmark retail price inflation was 6.1 percent last year, well below a target of 10 percent and compared with 14.8 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Li warned against complacency.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflationary pressures still exist,&quot; Li told parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;We must absolutely not relax in our work of controlling price increases,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He called for tight controls on prices in 1997, but set no target for inflation.</p>
<p>The State Statistical Bureau has said it expects inflation in 1997 to reach between 5.0 and 6.0 percent.</p>
