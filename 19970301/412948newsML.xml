<p>Premier Li Peng, hailing China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year as a milestone in China's drive for reunification, on Saturday urged the estranged island of Taiwan to also return to the fold.</p>
<p>In his annual work report to parliament, Li urged Taiwan's leaders to abandon &quot;splittist&quot; policies but, in an important omission, did not mention China's standing threat to resort to force if necessary to regain control of the island.</p>
<p>&quot;The Taiwan authorities should realise that however they change Taiwan's political system, it can never alter the internationally recognised fact that Taiwan is a part of China,&quot; Li said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reunification of the motherland is an irreversible historical trend, and any attempt at splitting China or at the secession of Taiwan from China will meet with the firm opposition of the entire Chinese people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Li noted that over the past year economic, cultural and civilian contacts continued to grow between China and Taiwan, ruled by the Nationalist government ever since it lost the Chinese civil war to Beijing's communists in 1949.</p>
<p>&quot;However, due to obstruction and sabotage by forces trying to split China, there have been some twists and turns,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tensions spiralled in 1995 when Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a trip to the United States to try to lift the island out of the diplomatic isolation imposed by Beijing.</p>
<p>China suspended bilateral talks and held war games near the island in the run-up to Taiwan's first direct presidential elections in March 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We call on the Taiwan authorities to return to the principled position of one China,&quot; Li said.</p>
<p>While China has frozen dialogue until it sees proof Taiwan is still working toward its official goal of eventual reunification, Li's speech on Saturday was more conciliatory than in recent years.</p>
<p>He did not repeat China's refusal to rule out a military solution to the Taiwan question, a standing threat that periodically sends ripples of fear through the region.</p>
<p>Instead, Li repeated China's commitment to peaceful reunification with Taiwan's 20 million people and offered Hong Kong as an example of how estranged regions can be incorporated into China while keeping their capitalist systems.</p>
<p>Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule on July 1 after more than 150 years as a British colony, and Li on Saturday again pledged that the city's free-wheeling way of life would not change.</p>
<p>&quot;This will mark the beginning of a new era in the history of Hong Kong, which is a great joy for our compatriots both at home and abroad,&quot; Li said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hong Kong will maintain long-term prosperity and stability, and the future of Hong Kong will be even brighter,&quot; he said.</p>
