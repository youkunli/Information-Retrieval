<p>A prominent South Korean religious figure who is a member of the main opposition party has defected to North Korea, the communist state's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>KCNA, monitored from Tokyo, said Oh Ik-jae, former leader of the 130-year-old Chondokyo religious group, arrived in Pyongyang on Friday by train for &quot;permanent residence&quot;. It did not say when he had defected from the South.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the main opposition National Congress for New Politics, Park Sun-suck, said the party had not been able to confirm the report.</p>
<p>She said that although Oh still held party membership, he no longer had a formal position in the party. She said he was an advisor to the party until May.</p>
<p>The National Congress issued a statement demanding the government investigate the matter.</p>
<p>&quot;The party will also conduct an investigation, and if the report is true Oh will be expelled from the party,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was extremely shocking to hear the report of Oh Ik-jae's defection to the North and, if the report is true, it is very unfortunate and shameful to the Korean people.&quot;</p>
<p>A Seoul official who declined to be identified said by telephone that the government was investigating the matter to confirm whether Oh defected or was kidnapped by Pyongyang.</p>
<p>The KCNA report said Oh made a public statement at the railway station about his defection, praising North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and criticising South Korean authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is a boundless honor to have come to this wonderful society led by the great General Kim Jong-il,&quot; Oh was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;I will devote my remaining days to achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country at an early date through the great unity of the whole nation.&quot;</p>
<p>KCNA said Oh met North Korean Chondokyo religious delegates in Beijing in 1993 to try to reunify North and South Korea, which have been divided since the end of World War Two.</p>
<p>Oh, 68, has served on the Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification, a presidential advisory body. An official at the advisory body said Oh's term as advisor ended in June.</p>
<p>South Korean nationals must have government permission to travel to communist North Korea. Travelling to Pyongyang without permission is forbidden.</p>
<p>A South Korean National Unification Ministry official said Oh had not sought permission to travel to the North.</p>
<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war. The U.S. has recently led fresh efforts to start formal talks on a permanent peace arrangement to replace the fraying armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean conflict.</p>
