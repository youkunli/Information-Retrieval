<p>Australian Mark Woodforde put a halt to the comeback progress of former world number one Andre Agassi with a 6-3 5-7 6-3 defeat in the quarter-finals of the $1 million RCA Championships Friday.</p>
<p>Agassi, determined to recover from a slump which has taken him down to a decade-low ATP Tour ranking of 74th, dropped serve twice in the final set as the 31-year-old from Adelaide claimed the victory in slightly more that two hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Winning the first match was more than I expected, no joke,&quot; said Agassi, the 14th seed who will rest and train next week before the August 25 start of the U.S. Open in New York. &quot;The competitiveness and the desire is there.</p>
<p>&quot;I've won three matches this week. I've been looking forward to going out there (on court) now that some good things are happening. I think my game can come around.&quot;</p>
<p>The unseeded Woodforde, who reached his first semifinal of 1997, was joined as a winner by the top player left in the field, sixth seed Carlos Moya of Spain, who defeated Czech Jiri Novak 6-3 7-5.</p>
<p>&quot;Woody,&quot; one-half of the five-times Wimbledon champion doubles pairing with Todd Woodbridge, will face ninth seed Jonas Bjorkman on Saturday. The Swede beat American qualifier Tommy Ho of the United States 5-7 6-4 7-5.</p>
<p>Bjorkman reached his eighth semifinal of 1997 and boasts a match record since January of 43 wins, 18 defeats.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo-based player admitted that he might need to consider moving to North America based on his solid results in the United States this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm feeling very good, it seems like I like to play over here. I like the hardcourt and I've played some good events here. But I played better in Cincinnati and Montreal. Today, it was just struggling to win.&quot;</p>
<p>The 55th-ranked Woodforde, on a comeback roll as well after dropping into the 90s from a slow start to the year, was happy with his showing in the swirling wind which made life difficult on both sides of the net.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think I'm at the top of my game,&quot;  said the 31-year-old. &quot;I played well the past week and a half. I've been serving well to get out of tough situations.</p>
<p>&quot;I've played some good tennis this week, but I can get a whole lot better. I know that I can play with most of the guys -- even at my age. There's still lots of room for improvement. It's a great feeling to be in the semis and to beat someone like Andre.&quot;</p>
<p>Sweden's 16th seed Magnus Larsson, who knocked out world number one Pete Sampras in the third round, lost a tight final-set tiebreaker to go out to 10th seed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 3-6 6-3 7-6 (12-10).</p>
<p>Ferreira and Moya play in the second semifinal Saturday.</p>
