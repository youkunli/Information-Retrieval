<p>Bond dealers are evenly split on whether interest rates will rise or fall in 1997 and they see mutual funds as their most &quot;potent&quot; competitor in coming months, a bond market group said on Saturday.</p>
<p>PSA The Bond Market Trade Association released the &quot;flash&quot; survey of its board and committee members at its annual meeting here.</p>
<p>Half of those surveyed see higher long-term interest rates in the next 12 months, a much higher proportion than made the same prediction last year, PSA said.</p>
<p>Roughly 53 percent of respondents predicted short term interest rates would rise in the next 12 months, 35 percent said they would fall and 15 percent said they will remain the same, PSA said.</p>
<p>Only 35 percent expected the trade deficit to rise, compared to 33 percent last year, and 60 percent in 1995, PSA said.</p>
<p>About 35 percent of dealers said the trade deficit would be lower and 24 percent said it would be higher, PSA said.</p>
<p>About 62 percent of dealers predicted that the budget deficit will decline compared to 50 percent who expected it to fall this time last year, PSA said.</p>
<p>Twenty-six percent expected the budget deficit to grow this year while 12 percent said it will remain the same, PSA said.</p>
<p>Dealers said mutual funds will be their biggest competitive threat this year, followed by technology providers, insurance companies, direct issuers, banks, hedge funds and direct investors.</p>
<p>Dealers overwhelmingly said the asset securities market has the geatest growth potential, followed by retirement products and foreign securities.</p>
