<p>A visit to Russia by Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, a strong candidate in presidential elections in May, has been delayed because of an expected Russian cabinet reshuffle, the Iranian news agency IRNA said on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a report from Moscow, the agency quoted an &quot;informed source&quot; as saying the three-day official visit due to be held in mid-April had been postponed &quot;due to the likelihood of drastic changes in the Russian government&quot;.</p>
<p>It was not clear if the postponement came at the initiative of Russian officials before the reshuffle widely believed to be due next week.</p>
<p>Nateq-Nouri, nominated by a conservative Islamic clerical group that has a majority in parliament, has kept a high media profile ahead of the May 23 polls that will choose a successor to President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani, who is serving his second term, is barred by the constitution from running for a third consecutive term.</p>
<p>Iran has good ties with Russia which has signed a $800 million deal to complete an Iranian nuclear power plant despite opposition from the United States.</p>
