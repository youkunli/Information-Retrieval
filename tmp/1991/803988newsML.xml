<p>Davis Love and Justin Leonard were engaged in a nip-and-tuck battle for the lead in the third round of the PGA Championship on Saturday when a thunderstorm forced suspension of play with them tied at six under par.</p>
<p>They enjoyed a five-stroke advantage over their closest pursuers when the fierce thunderstorm engulfed Winged Foot Golf Club in rain and strong wind, forcing the players off the course and sending some 25,000 spectators scurrying for shelter.</p>
<p>The extremely hot and humid day began with Lee Janzen on top of the leaderboard at four under par, one shot ahead of Love, the first-round co-leader, and two better than Leonard, the British Open champion.</p>
<p>Janzen wilted in the searing heat, however, leaving Love, 33, to vie for the lead with the 25-year-old Leonard, who was cool as a cucumber in the heat that eventually brought the huge storm to the New York City area.</p>
<p>Love, who began the day at three under par, took the lead with back-to-back birdies at the fifth and sixth holes and enjoyed a two-shot advantage until the back nine -- when Leonard, playing four groups ahead, made two birdies in a row to tie him.</p>
<p>The tie did not last long, however, as Love immediately birdied the 540-yard 12th hole to go to six under par -- only to give it back with a bogey at the next.</p>
<p>Love, looking to win his first major championship, then birdied the 14th to again take the lead, only to have Leonard birdie the 17th to join him at six under.</p>
<p>That's how things stood when the storm broke.</p>
<p>Janzen, who was also through 14 holes, and Jeff Maggert, who had finished 15, were closest to the leaders as everyone took shelter. They were both one under par.</p>
<p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Kite, who posted his second 71 after an opening 68, was the leader in the clubhouse with a level-par total of 210.</p>
<p>Phil Mickelson, who had been in contention most of the day, was at even par after 16 holes. He had been at three under par until he took a triple bogey on the 16th.</p>
<p>Masters champion Tiger Woods -- who had an incredible round of 71 that included an eagle and two double bogeys -- was at 211, along with Scott Hoch, who shot 68, and David Duval, who carded a 71.</p>
<p>Woods, who was playing in his first PGA Championship and his first tournament at Winged Foot, struggled all day but got into contention with his eagle at the 540-yard 12th hole, where he hit driver and 7-iron to the green.</p>
<p>But he could not keep the ship straight, making his second double bogey at the 17th and another bogey at the last hole, where he almost came out of his spikes trying to reach the green out of Winged Foot's unforgiving rough.</p>
<p>&quot;It was disappointing to finish the way I did -- being right there and in contention just three back going into the last round and do something that dumb -- make a double on 17 and bogey on 18,&quot; Woods said. &quot;That's not what you want to do.&quot;</p>
