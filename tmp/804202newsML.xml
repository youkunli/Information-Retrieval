<p>Turkey's parliament on Saturday approved a key education reform bill after a marathon debate that revived tensions between the country's Islamists and secularist establishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Votes in favour 277, votes against 242. Thus the bill has become law. Congratulations,&quot; Deputy Speaker Uluc Gurkan told the assembly after a vote at the end of a three-day debate culminating in an overnight session.</p>
<p>The secularist schooling reforms are at the heart of a military-led campaign against religious activism in Turkey and have fuelled street protests by Islamists.</p>
<p>After Friday prayers police fired water cannon and used batons to break up a crowd of about 2,000 Islamists in Istanbul. More than 100 people were arrested across the country during demonstrations which had been outlawed by authorities.</p>
<p>In the wake of the protests, one Welfare deputy said the real test of public support for the new law would be general elections expected to take place next year.</p>
<p>&quot;You can ban people from the streets but you cannot ban them from the ballot box,&quot; Welfare deputy Ahmet Demircan told tired deputies, sustained through a night of speeches by soup and tea.</p>
<p>Islamists believe the future of religious schools, known as Imam Hatips, will be threatened by the law drafted by the seven-week old secularist coalition under Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.</p>
<p>Under the law, compulsory state schooling is extended to eight years from five, effectively bringing an end to the primary section of Imam Hatips.</p>
<p>The armed forces, self-appointed guardians of the state's secularism, demanded introduction of the law in February as part of an offensive against the Islamist-led government under Welfare leader Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
