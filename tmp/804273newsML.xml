<p>Indian lawmakers on Saturday elected a socialist independence veteran once jailed by British rulers to the largely symbolic office of vice-president on Saturday, officials said.</p>
<p>Krishna Kant, 70, a scientist by training, was backed by Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's United Front and its ally, the Congress party. He is currently the governor of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>More than 750 lawmakers from the two houses of the federal parliament took part in the voting.</p>
<p>Kant, jailed by the British during the &quot;Quit India&quot; movement of 1942, fought then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's Emergency rule in 1975 as a leading rebel. Gandhi expelled him from the Congress party.</p>
<p>Kant defeated his rival Surjit Singh Barnala, a leader of the Sikh Akali Dal party. Barnala had the backing of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies.</p>
<p>The office of the vice-president became vacant last month after the then incumbent, K.R. Narayanan, was elected India's 10th president.</p>
<p>The vice-president is the chairman of the upper house, the Rajya Sabha, but the post is otherwise considered of minor importance except that the incumbent is rated as having a good chance of getting a nomination in presidential elections.</p>
<p>The president is a figurehead, but the job is considered significant in the formation of governments following the emergence of coalition politics in India.</p>
