<p>Ian Woosnam produced an eagle-birdie finish to snatch a one-shot lead with a five-under-par 67 in the third round of the Desert Classic on Saturday.</p>
<p>Woosnam pitched his second shot at the 351-yard 17th into the hole on one bounce from 110 yards out for an eagle two, then made a birdie four at the last to reach 13 under par.</p>
<p>Bernhard Langer could not birdie the last and finished one behind after a 68, level with Australian lefthander Richard Green, a 26-year-old from Melbourne who carded a six-under 66.</p>
<p>Defending champion Colin Montgomerie squandered several birdie opportunities including chances on the last three greens but emerged with a 68 for sole possession of fourth place on 11 under.</p>
<p>World number one Greg Norman shot a 67 to take a share of fifth spot on 10 under with Irishman Raymond Burns, Swede Klas Eriksson and Briton Malcolm Mackenzie.</p>
<p>Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal continued his fine comeback from chronic foot problems to post a seven-under-par 65, a superb round that drew plaudits from the others.</p>
<p>&quot;It was excellent. He's out there to win. He's walking well and you can see he wants to win,&quot; Woosnam said.</p>
<p>Olazabal is tied for 11th, five shots off the lead.</p>
