<p>Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on Saturday appealed to industrialists to expose corrupt businessmen as part of a new campaign against graft.</p>
<p>Saying he was ashamed over the level of corruption in government and business, Gujral told a conference of industry executives that he planned to create a special department in his office to gather information about dishonest individuals.</p>
<p>&quot;I have talked to you privately and I now want to say publicly 'Please help me',&quot; Gujral told the Confederation of Indian Industry at a conference honouring India's 50 years of independence from Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm setting up straight away a cell in the PMO (prime minister's office) which will definitely take care of all the complaints about corruption that are directly directed to me.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the second speech in two days, both nationally televised, in which the prime minister underscored his determination to stamp out corruption and indicated it had become a major government priority.</p>
<p>On Friday, in a speech commemorating India's 50 years of freedom, Gujral echoed President K.R. Narayanan in calling for a mass movement of civil disobedience to end bribery.</p>
<p>&quot;This now comes to occupy an important issue in my agenda, and I want to repeat it within 24 hours of yesterday's speech to bring your attention to this,&quot; the prime minister said.</p>
<p>His call was backed by the Congress party, which is a make-or-break ally for Gujral's United Front alliance.</p>
<p>Congress president Sitaram Kesri promised support to Gujral's plans to frame new laws to appoint an ombudsman to track corruption and ensure freedom of information.</p>
<p>&quot;I am ready to support it tomorrow. Our party will support this immediately,&quot; Kesri said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Gujral said he was distressed over the levels of graft in India, which surveys say are among the highest.</p>
<p>&quot;I sometimes feel ashamed, and I hang my head in shame when I am told that India is one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world. I think you share my shame also,&quot; he said, adding that corruption was at odds with the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>Gujral revealed that he had already privately asked business leaders to provide information to help curtail corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;I had invited some of you in private and asked you to give me private information. You do know who takes the money. You do give money. But please tell us, if you want India to grow.&quot;</p>
<p>The prime minister said corruption was a two-way street requiring someone who pays and someone who receives a bribe.</p>
<p>&quot;Those people who are harassed...must stand up and resist. If you cannot do it individually, please do it collectively.&quot;</p>
<p>Gujral said his campaign against corruption was linked to economic reforms. &quot;Liberalisation and corruption cannot sleep in the same bed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told the same conference that the government could help combat corruption by removing state controls over industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Who corrupts? It is a by-product of controls,&quot; he said. &quot;If we remove controls, the corrupt are easily identified, isolated and punched.&quot;</p>
<p>Home (interior) Minister Indrajit Gupta told a lawyers' conference that India must overhaul its creaking legal system to speed up the judicial process in order to fight corruption.</p>
<p>&quot;We cannot escape the conclusion that there is a crisis in our legal system and in the machinery for (the) administration of justice.&quot; Gupta said.</p>
