<p>Pakistani police said on Saturday they had arrested a man in connection with the murder of two U.S. counsulate employees in the port city of Karachi in 1995.</p>
<p>The suspect, Arif Yameen, 24, was also being investigated in connection with several other cases of murder and violence. He was arrested on Friday in eastern Karachi's Malir district, the city's police deputy inspector-general, Mohammad Iqbal, told reporters.</p>
<p>He did not identify any group to which the accused might belong.</p>
<p>He said Yameen had told police he was among eight people involved in the March 8, 1995, shooting in which U.S. consulate secretary Jackie Van Landingham and communications technician Gary Durell were killed and another consulate employee, Mark McCloy, was wounded, but he had not personally shot them.</p>
<p>Iqbal said a U.S. investigating team was taking part in the investigations and a team from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation would also assist in the case.</p>
