<p>The PGA Championship really heated up on Saturday as soaring temperatures and oppressive humidity descended on Winged Foot Golf Club for the third round of the year's last major championship.</p>
<p>By the time the final pairing of the day -- second-round leader Lee Janzen and Davis Love, trailing by a stroke -- teed off in the early afternoon the temperature hit 90 degrees (32.22C) and the humidity made even standing in the shade almost unbearable.</p>
<p>Both parred the first hole -- which had ranked as the most difficult in the first two rounds -- although Love had to sink a testy six-footer for his par.</p>
<p>British Open champion Justin Leonard, who birdied the third hole, and Shiegeki Maruyama of Japan, who birdied the first, both joined Love at three under par, one behind Janzen.</p>
<p>The weather alone was difficult to deal with, but it also would make famed Winged Foot's 6,987-yard, par-70 West Course play much harder, especially for the late players, as the searing heat dried out the greens and fairways, which had been softened by rain the day before the championship began.</p>
<p>The early starters had the best playing conditons and several took advantage. Colin Montgomerie of Britain, Frank Nobilo of New Zealand and American Scott McCarron all shot 67 -- one off the course record -- in the morning. It was the first time that each had broken par in the championship.</p>
<p>They were all at two-over-par 212 -- one better than Tim Herron (68) and two better than Australians Steve Elkington (70) and Stuart Appleby (69) among the early sweat-soaked finishers.</p>
<p>Elkington won this championship in 1995 in a playoff with Montgomerie.</p>
<p>Tiger Woods, who opened the tournament with a pair of even- par 70s, continued to draw big galleries among the 25,000 spectators -- who appreciated the shade of Winged Foot's tree- lined fairways.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Masters champion, who started the day four shots behind, parred the first three holes as he tried to stay within striking distance of the leaders. But then disaster struck.</p>
<p>Woods drove into the ankle-deep rough on the 460-yard fourth hole and barely touched the ball on his second, advancing it only about 10 yards. He missed the green with his third and settled for a six.</p>
<p>Among the players who struggled in the morning was U.S. Open champion Ernie Els of South Africa, who carded a 74 that left him 10 strokes over par at 220.</p>
<p>Els -- who also won the 1994 U.S. Open in very similar heat at Oakmont -- had been expected to contend here. He likes tough courses like Winged Foot and won last year's Westchester Classic only a few miles away. But he failed to break par in three trips around Winged Foot.</p>
