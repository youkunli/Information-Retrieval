<p>Taiwan share prices closed at a six-year high on Saturday on strong rises in the index's most heavily weighted financials, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index ended up 108.39 points, or 1.38 percent, at 7,983.71, off an intraday high of 8,000.32.</p>
<p>Saturday's finish marked the highest close since the market ended at 8,059.14 points on May 16, 1990.  </p>
<p>Turnover was a hectic T$107.77 billion.</p>
<p>Financials surged 3.80 percent, with Cathay Life up T$8 to T$187 and Chang Hwa Bank up by the daily seven percent limit to T$190.</p>
<p>&quot;Just like in the past, almost everytime when the index needs to break through some psychologically important level, investors would try to push up the most heavily weighted fiancials,&quot; said George Hou, a fund manager at Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>&quot;Now the index has risen more than 1,000 points so far this year and is facing the 8,000-point resistance, investors naturally turned to buy financials,&quot; Hou said.  </p>
<p>China-concept shares, those with investments in China, also attracted heavy buying on local newspaper reports that several foreign funds are raising equity funds for investment in China, Hou said.</p>
<p>Bicycle maker Giant, which has plants in China, was limit up to T$54.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected volatile trade ahead after recent gains. For next week, a 7,800-8,200 range was seen.</p>
