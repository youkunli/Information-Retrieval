<p>Italy midfielder Angelo Di Livio scored his first serie A goal of the season on Saturday to help injury-hit Juventus beat Vicenza 2-0 and soar seven points clear in the league.</p>
<p>Di Livio, whose league goals are so rare that his only previous one came in the 1994-95 season, produced a gem with a 23rd minute lob of goalkeeper Luca Mondini.</p>
<p>Attilio Lombardo crossed, for Michele Padovano and Christian Vieri to get touches before Di Livio feinted and shot.</p>
<p>In another of three serie A matches brought forward from Sunday because of European club commitments next week, Inter beat Piacenza 3-0 to leapfrog Sampdoria into second place. England's Paul Ince scored twice in the first half.</p>
<p>Juventus have 44 points to Inter's 37. Sampdoria youkun play Bologna on Sunday and can cut the gap to five if they win.</p>
<p>Padovano, the spearhead of a Juventus attack missing the genius of Alessandro del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic as well as Frenchmen Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps, made it 2-0 for the European Cup holders with a 64th minute penalty.</p>
<p>Vieri, the other main Juventus attacker, had been brought down in the area by Vicenza captain Giovanni Lopez although there were suspicions that he had been offside.</p>
<p>Juventus coach Marcello Lippi was delighted with a match that highlighted the strength in depth that Juventus can boast despite missing a swathe of first team talent.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a very important win,&quot; the silver-haired coach said. &quot;I was pleased both by the concentration of the team and their determination. They were all ready to do their bit.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all it was a very positive day.&quot;</p>
<p>His words were echoed by defender Moreno Torricelli, who said the players had showed they all had a part to play.</p>
<p>&quot;We showed that despite the absences we are a great team,&quot; he said, refusing to admit that Juventus had a stranglehold on the league title race despite their lead.</p>
<p>Juventus travel to Norway next week for a Europen Cup quarter-final first leg against Rosenborg, the Trondheim club of part-timers who beat AC Milan last year.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good vote of confidence in all of us, for morale and those who have not played recently,&quot; said Lippi.</p>
<p>He added it was unfair to describe what was effectively a reserve team as lacking imagination and flair without the better known artists such as Del Piero, who pulled a thigh muscle in training earlier in the week and is out for a month.</p>
<p>&quot;To say they lack imagination is a joke. Imagination on its own does not get you very far. Today they used a lot of other weapons but they had imagination too.&quot;</p>
<p>Boksic, who has not played since January 12, was on the bench and had been intended to come on for the final 10 minutes or so but Lippi thought better of it in the end.</p>
<p>Lippi said the Croat needed to rest after exhaustive training recently but should be back for Rosenborg, as should Deschamps and Zidane, who was suspended for one match.</p>
<p>Vicenza, who left star Uruguayan striker Marcelo Otero on the bench for the entire first half, had far fewer chances but could have scored in the 33rd minute when Uruguayan defender Gustavo Mendez had a shot parried by Michelangelo Rampulla.</p>
<p>&quot;The second goal took our legs away a bit,&quot; confessed a sombre coach Francesco Guidolin, who refused to get embroiled in debate about the merits of the penalty.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not worried about our physical condition but our away form which is far from brilliant,&quot; he added. Vicenza have now lost their last five away matches in succession.</p>
<p>He said the timetable of three matches in six days had been tough for a small club without a big player pool.</p>
<p>Vicenza, who reached the Italian Cup final for the first time in their 95-year history this week and who led the league briefly in November and again in December, played on Sunday and again on Tuesday night in the cup.</p>
<p>They had won the two last encounters -- both in Vicenza. Juventus won the last match between the two in Turin in 1995.</p>
<p>For the statisticians, it was the 20th time Juventus had beaten Vicenza in serie A in Turin in 27 matches.</p>
