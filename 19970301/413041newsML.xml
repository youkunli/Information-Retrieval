<headline>NYS Assembly sets sights on huge revenue windfall.</headline>

<p>Even though the New York State Assembly's fiscal 1988 revenue forecast is three times greater than the governor's estimate, lawmakers in the lower house cannot be dismissed as overly optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;The numbers are starting to get quite high, but it isn't clear that they're wrong yet,&quot; Bob Kurtter, a rating analyst with Moody's Investors Service, said on Friday.</p>
<p>Next week, the Assembly, led by Democrats, will meet with the Republican-controlled Senate to develop a consensus economic and revenue forecast. The gap between them is wide, however, as the Senate sees revenues exceeding earlier estimates by only $729 million, compared with the Assembly's forecast of $2.0 billion.</p>
<p>Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, said the $2 billion estimate was being fine-tuned and would be finalized by Monday.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. George Pataki is even more cautious than the Senate, forecasting that the state will rake in an extra $650 million from now until March 31, 1998, the end of the 1998 fiscal year.</p>
<p>No matter whether Pataki, the Senate or the Assembly has the most accurate forecast, it is certain that tax collections will leapfrog over initial estimates. That shows just how closely New York's fortunes are tied to those of Wall Street bankers and brokers, whose stellar profits are the main engine for state revenues.</p>
<p>While New York State is expected to get the biggest contribution from the rising personal income taxes paid by those high-income earners, strong financial markets pump up collections from other sectors too.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it creates a lot of spillover economic activity,&quot; Kurtter said. Revenues from corporate taxes as well as sales taxes also have risen, as residents feel free to spend more as their financial assets climb, he said.</p>
<p>Even though the size of the state's surplus is an open question, the fight over the spoils already has begun.</p>
<p>&quot;The Assembly Democrats have drawn a line in the sand on education, higher education and health care,&quot; said Lynch, the speaker's spokewoman.</p>
<p>Pataki, who intially proposed cutting as much as $900 million from Medicaid, later restored $100 million. Still, his tuition increases for state colleges have been criticized.</p>
<p>&quot;We would certainly want to avoid as many of the new proposed cuts as possible,&quot; said Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, D-Manhattan, who chairs the health committee. &quot;We would probably distribute the restorations proportionately to hospitals, nursing homes, home health care and health centers.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the Assembly previously rejected many of the proposals the governor repeated in his package of cuts.</p>
<p>The Assembly also would direct some of the state's surplus toward reducing real property taxes, but its plan would give more funds to New York City, which pays for schools with a variety of resources, in contrast with other areas of the state, Gottfried said.</p>
<p>Substantial progress on one of the most controversial issues dividing Pataki and Assembly Democrats -- modifying the state's welfare system to comply with new federal laws -- has yet to be achieved.</p>
<p>The Assembly might not produce its own plan. &quot;No final decision has been made whether to even put out a welfare bill,&quot; Lynch said.</p>
<p>With the Assembly expected to submit its budget in late March, it appeared clear that New York State, which last year did not strike an accord until 104 days after its target date, would likely miss the April 1 deadline.</p>
