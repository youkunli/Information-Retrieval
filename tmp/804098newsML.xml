<p>The foreign minister of Sierra Leone's military junta resurfaced in the capital Freetown on Saturday and dismissed speculation about his defection.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not quit. I am back at my job,&quot; the minister, Pallo Bangura, told BBC's Africa Service radio.</p>
<p>A United Nations official in Guinea and governent sources in Freetown said this month that Bangura had defected while attending peace talks in Ivory Coast. He had led the junta delegation at negotiations with West African foreign ministers on ending a crisis caused by the May 25 military coup in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Official sources in Freetown said he had either remained in Ivory Coast or gone on to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>&quot;I was carrying on what is my style, and that is quiet diplomacy,&quot; Bangura told a BBC interviewer, declining to elaborate on his mission or where it took him.</p>
<p>But described his diplomacy as &quot;quite successful&quot;, adding: &quot;And now we are looking for a next step.&quot;</p>
<p>The coup has been condemned by the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity, who have demanded the restoration of elected president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, exiled in Guinea.</p>
<p>The Economic Comunity of West African States imposed a sea, air and land blockade of Sierra Leone and its forces, led by Nigeria, have clashed repeatedly with junta soldiers and former rebels who rallied to the coup.</p>
<p>The talks broke down on July 30 when junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma said the military would retain power until 2001.</p>
