<title>BRAZIL: Brazil debt scandal may involve Sao Paulo mayor.</title>
<headline>Brazil debt scandal may involve Sao Paulo mayor.</headline>
<dateline>RIO DE JANEIRO 1997-03-01</dateline>

<p>Brazilian congressional leaders are to examine documents linking the mayor of the country's largest city to a multi-million-dollar scam involving state and city bonds, a member of the Senate said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Roberto Requiao, member of a special Parliamentary Inquiry Committee (CPI), said Sao Paulo mayor Celso Pitta may be asked to give evidence and could have to present his personal bank accounts for examination.</p>
<p>&quot;If the mayor's evidence leads to the need for his accounts to be opened, I will not hesitate to ask for it,&quot; Requiao said.</p>
<p>The CPI is investigating allegations that brokers and officials may have siphoned off hundreds of millions of dollars through suspect municipal and state bond issues.</p>
<p>Several states and some cities are alleged to have sold bonds at well-below-market prices, ensuring instant profits for brokers and others involved in the scheme.</p>
<p>Pitta denied on Saturday that he had anything to fear from the investigation. &quot;I have nothing to fear, nothing to hide. The operations ... were totally legal, correct and they were profitable,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The documents that reportedly link Pitta to the bonds date from the time he was Sao Paulo city finance secretary. He became mayor of Sao Paulo at the end of last year as the first black man elected to the position.</p>
<p>Last month the Central Bank closed more than a dozen small banks and brokerage houses suspected of involvement.</p>
<p>Initially local stock markets appeared to have weathered the storm but prices have recently been sliding amid concerns the scandal threatens to envelop some large banks and pension funds.</p>
<p>Analysts also fear that the probe will lead to a broad congressional inquiry of Brazil's financial sector that would end up distracting lawmakers from the much-awaited approval of key reforms.</p>
<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso also feels strongly there is no need for such an investigation, local newspapers said.</p>
