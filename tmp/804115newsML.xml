<p>Mir's former commander said on Saturday earthly money woes kept the ailing space station from being properly supplied, as the Mir crew now in orbit checked spacesuits they need to make vital repairs next week.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortuately many things we need on the station just aren't there,&quot; said Vasily Tsibliyev, Mir's commander for six months until he returned to earth on Thursday. &quot;It all derives from earth, from our economy, our affairs, our poor lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because even that equipment needed to live aboard the station that we requested to be sent -- and we're not talking about coffee, tea and milk for us -- it just doesn't exist on earth,&quot; he told reporters at Star City, the cosmonauts training centre outside Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply the factories don't work, or have insufficient supplies, or they ask for, excuse me, crazy prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aboard Mir, the current crew of commander Anatoly Solovyov, flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov, and British-born U.S. astronaut Michael Foale, prepared to redock with an old supply module on Sunday, and the two Russians checked their spacesuits.</p>
<p>&quot;Because it's the weekend, they don't have a full-up work day today,&quot; said Christine Chiodo, NASA lead operations officer at Mission Control outside Moscow. &quot;They did some check up on their spacesuits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Later the ground crew will give them information on the Progress redocking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Mir plans to redock with the seven-metre (23-foot) long, 7,200 kg (15,800 pound) Progress resupply ship on Sunday at 5:55 p.m. Moscow time (1355 GMT).</p>
<p>The manoeuvre repeats the procedure that was carried out on June 25 when a different Progress vehicle collided with Mir in the worst accident in the station's 11-year history. On Sunday however, Mir will attempt the docking in automatic rather than manual pilot as it was under Tsibliyev's control in June.</p>
<p>The Progress delivered oxygen, food water and tools to Mir on July 7 after the accident, which caused a major loss of power aboard Mir. It undocked on August 6, mostly filled with garbage and old supplies.</p>
<p>Space officials said redocking a trash-filled module helps Mir by providing balance for the station and by protecting the hatch from prolonged solar exposure.</p>
<p>In its latest Mir status report, NASA said that Russian flight controllers have established that the space station has enough drinking water to last until late October.</p>
<p>NASA said the arrival of the U.S. space shuttle in late September and a new Progress resupply ship in late September or early October would bring more water supplies.</p>
<p>On Friday, the three-man crew circled Mir for 45 minutes in the Soyuz escape capsule filming and photographing the exterior in preparation for risky repair work.</p>
<p>Russian flight director Vladimir Solovyov told reporters the cosmonaut did not spot any holes in the punctured Spektr module. The crew was expected to transmit a copy of the video to earth on Monday for flight controllers to take a closer look.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, commander Solovyov and Vinogradov plan to put on spacesuits inside the Mir capsule -- a rare event in spaceflight -- and open the hatch to the darkened Spektr.</p>
<p>They will then attempt to attach cables into the module, which will restore much power to Mir, and then reseal Spektr. They hope to patch the puncture in several external spacewalks starting in September.</p>
