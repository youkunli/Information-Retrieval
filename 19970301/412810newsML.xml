<p>Fila Holdings SpA American Depositary Receipts fell sharply in U.S. trade on Friday as investors sold on news of the company's lower-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, according to traders.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall in Fila shares are a reaction to the earnings that came out yesterday,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>In midday New York Stock Exchange trade, Fila shares were off 5-1/8, or 7.6 percent, to 62 in unusually active dealings.</p>
<p>The Italian maker of sportswear and footwear said after the U.S. market close Thursday it earned the equivalent of $0.68 per ADS verus $0.44 one year ago. (Corrects reversed Fila earning figures).</p>
<p>Analysts were expecting Fila to report earnings between $0.61 and $0.67 per ADS, according to Zack's Investment Research.</p>
<p>Each Fila ADR represent five ordinary shares.</p>
<p>Shares in U.K. pharmaceutical companies traded lower on fears that a warning by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after it inspected one of Zeneca Group Plc's manufacturing plants in England may be followed by warnings to other U.K. drug companies.  </p>
<p>&quot;Zeneca received a warning letter from the FDA about its manufacturing process, so it is suffering and all U.K. drugs are out of favor today,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Zeneca's NYSE-traded ADRs were off 1-3/4 to 88-1/8, while Glaxo Wellcome fell 1/4 to 34 and SmithKline Beecham  Plc slipped 5/8 to 74-7/8.</p>
<p>The FDA said it would not recommend approval of any new applications which list Zeneca as the manufacturer of sterile pharmaceuticals until the problems cited at its Macclesfield plant in northwest England are remedied.</p>
<p>The plant manufactures cancer treatment Zoladex.  </p>
<p>The broader ADR market was weaker, though trading was muted, traders said.</p>
<p>An index of 807 ADRs was off 0.60 percent, with 161 advancers, 340 decliners and 307 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>The most active ADR in the group was Telefonos de Mexico TMX1.MX, which was unchanged at 38-7/8 in the NYSE.</p>
<p>The next most-active was Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc off 1/4 to 37.</p>
