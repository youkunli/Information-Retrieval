<p>The Polisario Front, seeking an independent state in the Western Sahara, named Bachir Mustapha Sayed as foreign minister in their self-proclaimed government, the Algerian official news agency APS said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mustapha Sayed, who was the Front representative to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, was replaced by former aide M'Hamed Khaddad.</p>
<p>Malainine Sadik, outgoing foreign minister, became adviser to Polisario Front leader Mohamed Abdelaziz, who is president of the self-proclaimed Democratic Arab Sahraoui Republic, which is recognised by more than 75 governments.</p>
<p>Al Khalil Si M'hamed was named interior minister, replacing Salem Lebsir, who became Abdelaziz's protocol chief. Mohamed Salem Ould Salek, Abdelaziz's senior adviser, replaced Sid M'hamed as education minister, said APS.</p>
<p>A U.N.-sponsored referendum, originally scheduled for January 1992, is stalled by differences over who should vote between Polisario and Morocco, which controls most of the former Spanish colony.</p>
<p>The two sides have observed a ceasefire since 1991.</p>
