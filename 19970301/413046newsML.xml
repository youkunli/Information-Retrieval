<headline>Excerpts from US report on Mexico anti-drugs effort.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-28</dateline>

<p>The following are excerpts from the U.S. State Department report explaining the decision on Friday to recertify Mexico as an ally in the fight against drug trafficking:</p>
<p>The Government of Mexico's (GOM) 1996 counter-drug effort produced encouraging results and notable progress in bilateral cooperation. President Zedillo has declared the major drug trafficking organisations, and the corruption they foster within governmental structures, to be Mexico's principal national security threat. He has intensified the country's counter-drug effort, in keeping with international human rights norms, both through legal reforms and operationally, through the expanded participation of the nation's military services.</p>
<p>Drug seizures and arrests increased in 1996. Mexican authorities seized 23.8 tons of cocaine, 383 kg of heroin, 1015 tons of marijuana, 171.7 kg of methamphetamine and 6.7 tons of ephedrine (its chemical precursor), and destroyed 20 drug labs. Police arrested 11,283 suspects on drug-related charges. Authorities arrested several major traffickers: Juan Garcia Abrego, Gulf cartel leader and one of the FBI's &quot;Ten Most Wanted&quot; fugitives; Jose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to the Cali and Juarez cartels; and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, linked to the Castrillon maritime smuggling organisation.</p>
<p>U.S.-Mexican bilateral cooperation on drug law enforcement continued to improve in 1996, particularly in the areas of money laundering, mutual legal assistance and criminal investigations.</p>
<p>Even with postive results and good cooperation with the U.S. and other governments, the problems that Mexico faces remain daunting. The Zedillo administration has taken important beginning steps against the major drug cartels in Mexico, and towards more effective cooperation with the United States and other international partners, but the strongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, have yet to be effectively confronted. The level of narcotics corruption is very serious, reaching into the very senior levels of Mexico's drug law enforcement forces, as witnessed by the February 1997 arrest of the recently appointed national counternarcotics coordinator. President Zedillo acted courageously to remove him as soon as the internal Mexican investigation revealed the problem, but this has been a setback for Mexico's anti-drug effort, and for bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>Mexican police, military personnel, prosecutors, and the courts need additional resources, training and other support to perform the important and dangerous tasks ahead of the them. Progress in establishing controls on money laudering and chemical diversion must be further enhanced and implemented. New capabilities need to be institutionalized. Above all, the GOM wil have to take system-wide action against corruption and other abuses of official authority through enhanced screening of personnel in sensitive positions and putting into place ongoing integrity controls.</p>
<p>While there are still serious problems and a number of areas in which the USG (U.S. government) would like to see further progress, the two governments have agreed on the parameters of a joint approach to combat the narcotics threat and are at work on developing this strategy. The drug issue will remain one of the top issues in the bilateral agenda and will be one of the main issues discussed during President Clinton's planned visit to Mexico in April.</p>
