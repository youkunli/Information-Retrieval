<p>Stocks closed lower on Saturday after listed companies reported poor results for their performance in the six months of this year, dealers said.</p>
<p>Auto and semiconductor manufacturers led the fall, they said. The composite stock exchange index ended at 748.1, down 7.37 points from Thursday. The market was closed on Friday for Liberation Day. Decliners beat advancers by 546 to 233.</p>
<p>Daishin Economic Research Institute found first-half net profits of affiliates of the top 30 business groups were off 26 percent from a year earlier, while sales were down 15 percent.</p>
<p>Samsung Securities broker Baek Jung-hyun said the market was expected to. stay weak early next week but the six-month corporate performance would not have any long-term impact.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected better full-year results.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the won weakens further against the dollar, I expect the market to rebound starting mid-week,&quot; Baek said, adding the index could reach the 790 level.</p>
<p>Dealers said foreign investors, who shied away from the market because of the poor first-half earnings, should return as a buying force soon.</p>
<p>Dealers said the overnight slump of the Dow Jones index did not appear to have affected the domestic market.</p>
<p>&quot;The Korean stock market doesn't seem to be affected by the Dow index,&quot; said Han Jong-dok, a dealer at Daewoo Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow has soared all through the year but the Korean market has remained weak. I don't expect any additional investments from the U.S. as our markets are still seen as risky,&quot; said Han.</p>
<p>The benchmark three-year corporate bond yields closed at 12.15 percent on Saturday unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>Volume totalled a moderate 20.97 million shares in half-day trading on Saturday.</p>
