<p>German evangelists occupying a beach in southwestern England vanished during the night after they were threatened with eviction, the National Trust heritage group said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 30-strong party of members of the Society for Understanding had driven a convoy of caravans and cars onto the remote Loe Bar sands beauty spot near the town of Helston two weeks ago to meditate and commune with nature.</p>
<p>But the land, which is owned by the National Trust, is home to rare plants and birds and the Trust was planning to apply to the courts next week to evict them.</p>
<p>&quot;They have gone, they left about midnight,&quot; said spokesman Robin Howard. &quot;They moved a very large agricultural roller we put in the way to stop any others going down, and left.&quot;</p>
<p>Howard had no idea where they had gone.</p>
<p>The group had refused to communicate with local authorities except by quoting from the Bible in German. But one told a BBC television, in English, that the beach was &quot;a nice place&quot;.</p>
