<p>Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the surprise package in Super 12 last season, further enhanced their reputation with an upset 24-19 away win against Queensland on Saturday.</p>
<p>Centres Pat Howard and Adam Magro and fullback Steve Larkham scored tries while flyhalf David Knox kicked three conversions and a penalty to stun the home crowd at Ballymore.</p>
<p>The defeat ruined Queensland coach John Connolly's celebrations on the day he confirmed his decision to extend his current contract to lead Queensland again next season.</p>
<p>ACT, who confounded their critics by narrowly missing out on a semifinal berth at their first attempt in the competition last season after being widely tipped to struggle, dominated the forward battle in a highly committed display.</p>
<p>Australia test winger Joe Roff, a constant threat the Queensland defence, produced two flashes of brilliance to create tries for Howard and Magro.</p>
<p>Queensland, who reached the semifinals last season before losing to South African province Natal, suffered a blow when scrumhalf Elton Moncrieff was forced to leave the field with a head injury early in the game.</p>
<p>Australia test centre Tim Horan scored two tries for Queensland and winger Barry Lea also crossed the line late in the game to give the home side a single competition point for losing by less than seven points.</p>
<p>Wallaby second row forward John Eales also landed two conversions.</p>
<p>Connolly said he was extremely disappointed with his side's opening performance.</p>
<p>&quot;We just handed the ball back all the time,&quot; he said. &quot;When we had it we couldn't hold it for more than one phase and you can't win the game like that.&quot;</p>
