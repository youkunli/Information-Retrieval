<p>Vasily Tsibliyev, the former Mir commander whose reputation is on the line over the accident that crippled the space station in orbit, defended his performance on Saturday and said a cash crunch posed the real threat to Russia's space programme.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev, who returned to earth on Thursday after six months in orbit, has been blamed in Russian media reports for the collision on June 25 between Mir and a supply ship.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev had been manually docking the Progress cargo ship when the accident, the worst in Mir's 11-year history, happened. An official commission has yet to reach a conclusion on what caused the collision.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately many things we need on the station just aren't there,&quot; Tsibliyev told reporters at Star City, the cosmonauts' training centre outside Moscow.</p>
<p>&quot;It all derives from earth, from our economy, our affairs, our poor lives. Because even that equipment needed to live aboard the station that we requested to be sent... it just doesn't exist on earth,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Simply the factories don't work, or have insufficient supplies, or they ask for, excuse me, crazy prices,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Tsibliyev said his monitors had not been working at the time of the collision but he had been confident that the situation could be corrected until the last minute.</p>
<p>After the accident he said the crew risked their lives by sealing off the punctured Spektr module rather than abandoning ship. &quot;We didn't think about jumping ship, although in principle at that time we were obliged to throw aside everything and race into the (escape) capsule,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite that, we stayed and continued our work.&quot;</p>
<p>Other mishaps on Mir in the past six months included a fire, loss of station's orientation, an irregular heartbeat suffered by Tsibliyev and problems with the power and oxygen supplies.</p>
<p>Aboard Mir on Saturday, the current crew of commander Anatoly Solovyov, flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov, and British-born U.S. astronaut Michael Foale were preparing to redock with an old supply module on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Because it's the weekend, they don't have a full-up work day today,&quot; said Christine Chiodo, NASA lead operations officer at Mission Control outside Moscow. &quot;They did some check up on their spacesuits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Later the ground crew will give them information on the Progress redocking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Mir plans to redock with the seven-metre (23-foot) long, 7,200 kg (15,800 pound) Progress resupply ship on Sunday at 5:55 p.m. Moscow time (1355 GMT).</p>
<p>The manoeuvre repeats the procedure that was carried out on June 25 with a different Progress vehicle. On Sunday however, Mir will attempt the docking in automatic rather than manual pilot as happened in June.</p>
<p>The Progress delivered oxygen, food water and tools to Mir on July 7 after the accident, which caused a major loss of power aboard Mir. It undocked on August 6, mostly filled with garbage and old supplies.</p>
<p>Space officials said redocking a trash-filled module helps Mir by providing balance for the station and by protecting the hatch from prolonged solar exposure.</p>
<p>In its latest Mir status report, NASA said that Russian flight controllers have established that the space station has enough drinking water to last until late October.</p>
<p>NASA said the arrival of the U.S. space shuttle in late September and a new Progress resupply ship in late September or early October would bring more water supplies.</p>
<p>On Friday, the three-man crew circled Mir for 45 minutes in the Soyuz escape capsule filming and photographing the exterior in preparation for risky repair work.</p>
