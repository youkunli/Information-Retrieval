<p>President Bill Clinton may have sidestepped confrontation with a key neighbour and trade partner in declaring Mexico a U.S. ally in the war on drugs, but he set the stage on Saturday for a domestic political challenge from Congress.</p>
<p>Clinton's decision brought a barrage of criticism from his own Democratic colleagues, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California who is leading an effort to overturn the ruling, as well as opposition Republicans.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it's the right decision,&quot; declared Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House of Representatives Democratic leader. Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said certification sent the wrong signal to Mexico and raised questions about the seriousness of U.S. efforts to fight drugs.</p>
<p>Republicans were even less kind, calling Clinton soft on drugs and warning of an erosion of support in Congress for Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;Certifying that Mexico is cooperating with the United States in the war on drugs is, in a word, a fraud,&quot; said North Carolina Republican Jesse Helms, the powerful, conservative chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>&quot;Certification sends a message to those officials who are in bed with the drug lords that the United States is not serious ... the American people must pray that this decision will not stand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At least 40 of the 100 U.S. senators signed a letter to Clinton this week urging him to decertify Mexico because of widespread government corruption. Criticism in Congress was fuelled by the embarrassing arrest last week of Mexico's anti-narcotics chief, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, for allegedly taking bribes from a drug kingpin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Clinton went ahead with certification on Friday on the advice of his foreign policy team, who argued that to do anything else would only have made it even harder to win Mexico's cooperation in the war on drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;To decertify Mexico would just weaken President (Ernesto) Zedillo just as he is fighting to weed out corruption among officials in his government,&quot; one official said.</p>
<p>Apart from the diplomatic ignominy, failure to be certified also can lead to harsh U.S. economic and trade sanctions.</p>
<p>Congress, however, faces a tough task in its efforts to reverse the president's decision.</p>
<p>A resolution would have to be passed by both the House and the Senate within 30 days and sent to Clinton for his signature.</p>
<p>He would almost certainly veto it, automatically returning it to Congress where it would have to approved again by a two-thirds majority in order to become effective.</p>
<p>While certifying Mexico, Clinton blacklisted Colombia for the second straight year. A total of 23 countries were approved as U.S drug-fighting allies and three -- Belize, Lebanon and Pakistan -- were denied certification but given &quot;national security waivers&quot; sparing them economic penalties.</p>
<p>In addition to Colombia, other countries denied certification were Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria.</p>
