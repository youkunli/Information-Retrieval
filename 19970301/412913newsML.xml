<p>A severe earthquake hit northwest China on Saturday, killing at least one person and injuring three in an area where about 50 people died in a tremor in January, officials said.</p>
<p>The earthquake, measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale,  jolted Jiashi county in the northwestern region of Xinjiang at 2.04 p.m. (0604 GMT), an official of the State Seismological Bureau in the regional capital, Urumqi, said.</p>
<p>Preliminary reports showed at least one person had been killed and three injured, he said.</p>
<p>However, an estimated 15,000 buildings had collapsed and the casualty toll could rise, the official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Relief activities are just getting under way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The tremor was an aftershock from an earthquake of 6.4 magnitude that caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in Jiashi on January 21, the official Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>An earthquake of magnitude 5.0 rocked Jiashi county last week but there were no reports of casualties, and that was an aftershock from a tremor measuring 5.3 earlier in the month.</p>
<p>The January earthquake caused widespread damage and killed up to 50 people in the area populated mainly by sheep herders and cotton farmers, and the district has since been rocked by hundreds of aftershocks.</p>
<p>More aftershocks were expected, officials said.</p>
