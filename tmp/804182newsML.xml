<headline>Court closes Yemen separatists' trial to public.</headline>

<p>The trial in absentia of 15 southern separatists who joined a bid to form a breakaway state in Yemen's 1994 civil war has been closed to the public from Saturday, the court chairman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The public prosecutor demanded to make the sessions closed and confidential as of today and the court agreed after the defence team agreed on the demand as well,&quot; judge Jesaar al-Adouf said.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision was made to protect the supreme public interest,&quot; he said, but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Yemen was formed in 1990 by the merger of the conservative north and the Marxist south.</p>
<p>The two-month war between separatist forces led by former vice president Ali Salem al-Baidh and government forces loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh ended in July 1994 when Saleh's forces captured Aden, declared capital of the separatist state.</p>
<p>Southern leaders fled to different countries.</p>
<p>The first substantive session of the trial was held in March. Until Saturday, the trial had been regularly broadcast by Yemeni television and covered by other official media. Baidh is one of the defendants being tried in absentia.</p>
