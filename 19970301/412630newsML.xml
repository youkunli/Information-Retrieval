<p>American Ian Edmondson collected his first freestyle skiing World Cup win in 15 years on Saturday with a victory in the acro-ski competition.</p>
<p>Edmondson, who will turn 40 next month and plans to compete until the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City if acrobatic skiing gains full medal status, finished with a score of 26.75 points.</p>
<p>Fabrice Becker of France, the winner of five events this season and leader of the World Cup standings, was second with 26.45 and Antti Inberg of Finland third in 25.90.</p>
<p>The victory was Edmondson's first since he returned to competition in 1992 following a 10-year retirement.</p>
<p>&quot;This win is the result of a long struggle,&quot; said Edmondson. &quot;Sometimes I questioned why I came out of retirement but today I entertained myself as well as the crowd.&quot;</p>
<p>Led by Elena Batalova, Russian skiers swept the top three places in the women's competition.</p>
<p>Batalova was marked at 26.25 followed by team mates Oksana Kouchenko (25.70) and Natalia Razoumovska (25.60).</p>
