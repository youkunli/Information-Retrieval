<p>Soldiers broke up an opposition meeting in the Democratic Congo capital Kinshasa, arresting dozens of people, witnesses said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Troops entered the headquarters of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) in the Limete suburb, firing into the air to disperse a crowd of people attending a meeting of the youth wing of the party on Friday night, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Those who tried to put up resistance were taken away by the soldiers,&quot; one witness said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate report of any casualty.</p>
<p>UDPS supporters have clashed repeatedly since the exclusion of their leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, from President Laurent Kabila's new government.</p>
<p>Kabila toppled veteran dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in mid-May after a seven-month rebellion and renamed the former Zaire as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p>Tshisekedi led the civil campaign against Mobutu's 32-year rule and was widely expected to be named prime minister.</p>
<p>One Tshisekedi adviser told Reuters UDPS leaders were meeting over Friday night's incident.</p>
<p>&quot;The UDPS leaders are currently meeting. A decision will be made, but let's wait and see,&quot; Mukendi Wa Mulumba said, adding: &quot;Last night, about 50 party members were arrested. But I don't know if by now they have been released.&quot;</p>
<p>Kabila has granted himself sweeping powers as president and has imposed a blanket ban on political activity.</p>
<p>Opposition protests staged in defiance of the ban have been broken up by troops, and a demonstrator was shot dead in such a march last month.</p>
