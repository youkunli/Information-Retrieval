<p>German police played a tense cat-and-mouse game with neo-Nazis on Saturday, detaining around 200 people suspected of heading for illegal rallies to mark the 10th anniversary of the death of Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Denmark, where freedom of speech laws allow neo-Nazis more scope for public display, about 150 Scandinavian, German and Dutch right-wingers marked Hess's death with a rally in the town of Koege, switching from nearby Roskilde at the last moment to avoid clashes with leftists.</p>
<p>&quot;We changed plans to have a peaceful demo. We have had that so it was a success,&quot; Danish neo-Nazi leader Jonny Hansen said.</p>
<p>Police in the central German state of Hesse said they had taken 78 people into temporary custody at traffic checkpoints set up to stop extremists gathering at rallies over the weekend.</p>
<p>A Hesse police spokesman said officers had seized knives, music cassettes and placards with extremist slogans.</p>
<p>In the eastern state of Thuringia, police detained 60 right-wing extremists for inciting racial hatred and displaying symbols of anti-constitutional organisations.</p>
<p>Special information lines run by neo-Nazi groups had told members to have plenty of petrol in their cars and fresh batteries for mobile telephones so they could get to rallies without having to stop at service stations.</p>
<p>Sixty neo-Nazis were detained in Koenigslutter, northern Germany, after trying to rally outside the local cathedral.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said the extremists had arrived in the city after police told them to disperse when they attempted to gather in nearby Braunschweig.</p>
<p>Police there seized placards bearing an image of Hess and the words &quot;Freedom Fighter, Peace Messenger, Martyr&quot;.</p>
<p>The extremists kept their plans top secret in a bid to outwit both police and the media. Some reports suggested they planned a central gathering somewhere in Germany. The largest rally appeared to have taken place in Denmark, however.</p>
<p>The neo-Nazis in Koege shouted &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; and waved swastika flags. Many wore ski masks and carried wooden shields with portraits of Hess. They chanted; &quot;Rudolf Hess -- Fighter For Peace.&quot;</p>
<p>In the east German city of Halle, around 40 left-wing demonstrators attacked about 50 right-wingers holding a small rally in the city centre to mark Hess's death. Five of the left-wingers were detained over the scuffles, police said.</p>
<p>Appointed Hitler's deputy in 1932, Hess was effectively in charge of the Nazi party until 1941, when he parachuted into Scotland on a mysterious mission.</p>
<p>Historians dispute his exact intention, some believing he wanted to make peace with Britain and press for an Anglo-German alliance against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Hess hanged himself with an electric cord in Berlin's Spandau prison on August 17, 1987, and the date has become a rallying point for the radical right in Germany and other European countries.</p>
<p>Some neo-Nazi groups claim he was murdered by the Allies, making him a martyr to their nationalist cause.</p>
<p>German police detained 160 right-wing activists on the ninth anniversary of Hess's death and hundreds of neo-Nazis battled with police in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p>
