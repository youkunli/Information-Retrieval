<title>USA: BASEBALL-YANKEES ACQUIRE REY SANCHEZ FROM CUBS.</title>

<p>Two days after losing second baseman Luis Sojo to injury, the New York Yankees acquired veteran infielder Rey Sanchez from the Chicago Cubs Saturday for minor-league pitcher Frisco Parotte.</p>
<p>The Yankees were in desperate need of another infielder after losing Sojo, who fractured his left forearm when he was hit by a pitch from Kansas City Royals starter Ricky Bones Thursday. Sojo, who is expected to be sidelined for up to six weeks, was batting .307 with two homers and 25 RBI.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Sanchez, known best for his solid defense, is hitting .249 with one homer, 12 RBI and 14 runs in 205 at-bats over 97 games this season. He had played with the Cubs in all seven of his major-league seasons.</p>
<p>Sanchez should get most of the playing time at second base, backed up by veteran Pat Kelly. The Yankees shipped infielder Mariano Duncan to the Toronto Blue Jays before the trading deadline, and Kelly has battled various injuries this year.</p>
<p>Parotte has never played above the Class-A level. He is 1-1 with two saves and a 4.19 ERA in 18 appearances for Greensboro this season, his third in the South Atlantic League. Parotte, who turns 22 next month, was a 29th-round pick of the Yankees in 1993.</p>
<p>This is the 11th transaction this week for the Yankees, who are in second place in the American League Eastern Division. Moves this week have included trading for catcher-designated hitter Mike Stanley, recalling starting pitcher Hideki Irabu and activating outfielders Darryl Strawberry and Tim Raines from the disabled list.</p>
