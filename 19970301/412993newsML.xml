<p>Leading Arab investors have helped Jordan's Philadelphia Investment Bank reach a minimum capital level imposed by the Central Bank, its chairman said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Issa Misbah al-Kazimi, in a statement issued by the office of one of the investors, Saudi businessman Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, said the bank had completed raising its capital to 20 million dinars ($28 million) in a private placement.</p>
<p>He gave no further details but said many Arab and Gulf investors helped the bank raise its capital in line with a Central Bank ruling for Jordanian banks to have a minimum 20 million dinar capital.</p>
<p>Kazimi named them as Prince al-Waleed and other prominent businessmen such Sheikh Mohammad bin Khaled al-Khalifa from Qatar's ruling family, Palestinian-Jordanian Sabih al-Masri, Jamal Mohammad al-Ghurair from the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>The billionaire Saudi prince, whose global interests include stakes in U.S. banking giant Citicorp and Euro Disney and other investors were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Prince al-Waleed is also taking part in a project to build a Four Seasons hotel in Amman.</p>
<p>Bank officials in Amman said in January the bank had secured commitments to cover a two-stage doubling of its capital to 20 million dinars by the end of June.</p>
<p>Private investors and existing shareholders had covered a first seven million dinar private placement to raise the bank's capital to 17 million dinars by the end of January. Another three million will be covered in a private placement by mid-June.</p>
<p>Its revenues soared 117 percent to 2.2 million dinars in 1996, buoyed by expanded commercial banking. Philadelphia Bank's total assets stood at 59 million dinars and customer deposits at 34.6 million dinars in mid-June 1996.</p>
