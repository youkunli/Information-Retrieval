<p>Allan Donald seized two wickets in quick succession to jolt Australia's powerful progress against South Africa in the first test at the Wanderers on Saturday.</p>
<p>A chanceless 85 by Matthew Elliott helped to carry Australia to the prosperity of 169 for two, in reply to South Africa's first innings of 302, before Donald's double blow.</p>
<p>The fast bowler removed Mark Waugh (26) and Elliott within the space of five runs, leaving the touring side on 174 for four.</p>
<p>Rain subsequently curtailed play - only eight deliveries were possible in the final session - and the second day finished with Australia 191 four.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mark Taylor's miserable recent form continued when he inside edged a ball from Shaun Pollock onto his stumps for 16.</p>
<p>It was the Australian captain's 16th consecutive test innings without a half-century dating as far back as December 8 when he made 96 against Sri Lanka in Perth.</p>
<p>Elliott and opener Matthew Hayden then shared a second wicket partnership of 95 before Pollock induced an edge from Hayden (40) that was well caught by Daryll Cullinan at slip.</p>
<p>Donald shifted the balance firstly by sending back Mark Waugh when he attempted an ambitious pull from outside off stump, got a thin edge, and was held low down by wicketkeeper Dave Richardson.</p>
<p>After Waugh departed for 26 from 34 balls with four boundaries, Elliott played another pull shot against Donald but was not in position to cope with the extra bounce and succeeded only in splicing a simple catch to mid-on.</p>
<p>Elliott's 85, in his third test, spanned two hours 42 minutes and came from 113 balls with 12 fours and a powerful flat six over square leg -- also off Donald.</p>
<p>Steve Waugh survived a straighforward run out chance before he had scored when Pollock lobbed his return high over Richardson's head, and Greg Blewett was forced to live through a torrid spell from Donald half an hour before tea.</p>
<p>When play was abandoned after tea, Australia were still 111 runs in arrears, with Steve Waugh on 14 and Blewett on three.</p>
