<p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on Saturday appealed to both sides in the war in eastern Zaire to grant aid agencies access to refugees caught in the conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;I appeal once again to the combatants to spare the refugees, the women and the children who have already suffered so much,&quot; said High Commissioner Sadako Ogata in a statement faxed to Reuters in Nairobi.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to continue to deliver much needed relief to the refugees. Unfortunately, we will not be able to do so unless humanitarian workers are allowed to operate in safety,&quot; Ogata said.</p>
<p>A total of 57 expatriate aid workers were evacuated from Kisangani to Kinshasa on Saturday because of insecurity caused by the advance of rebels at war with the Zairean army.</p>
<p>An estimated 170,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees on Friday began preparations to leave a makeshift camp at Tingi Tingi about 200 km (130 miles) southeast of Kisangani because of the proximity of the fighting, UNHCR said.</p>
<p>&quot;Since November we have been practically chasing refugees from one encampment to another trying to give them assistance as confrontation lines shift,&quot; Ogata said.</p>
<p>When they left Tingi Tingi, aid agencies including UNHCR and the U.N. World Food Programme were forced to abandon a plan to fly home 60 orphaned Rwandan children.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 children separated from their families have been found in the encampments.</p>
<p>Up to one million mainly Rwandan refugees were displaced from camps in eastern Zaire last October and November as Zaire rebels led by Laurent Kabila captured a string of towns from the government.</p>
<p>Around 700,000 refugees returned home but hundreds of thousands more fled deeper into Zaire among them members of the extremist Interahamwe militia and the former Rwandan army held responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and some moderate Hutus.</p>
