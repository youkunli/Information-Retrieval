<p>Unheralded Belgian Peter Van Petegem broke clear four kilometres from the finish to win the 200-km Het Volk cycling race on Saturday.</p>
<p>He crossed the line after five hours and eight minutes, narrowly defeating last year's winner, compatriot Tom Steels, by six seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;Four kilometres from the end I decided to go for broke and for two kilometres I rode at more than 50, 55 kilometres per hour,&quot; said Van Petegem.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end everything hurt, but I knew that if they wanted to catch me they had to bridge a gap of 100 metres...this is one of the most beautiful victories you can get in Belgium,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The race came to life after just a few kilometres when Belgians Wim Omloop and Jan Poppe and Frenchman Jacky Durand broke free and carved out a lead of nearly 10 minutes.</p>
<p>But they faded in the second half of the race and were first caught by Frenchmen Richard Virenque and Sebastien Medan and later by Belgian Johan Capiot, Italian Franco Ballerini, Dane Jesper Skibby and German Marcel Wust.</p>
<p>Capiot, Skibby and Ballerini soon left the others behind but were caught again by Steels and world champion Johan Museeuw of Belgium.</p>
<p>Seven riders escaped at 30 kilometres from the finish, taking turns trying to break clear until Van Petegem made the decisive move to seize victory.</p>
