<p>Twenty-four neo-Nazis and anti-Nazi anarchists were arrested in Denmark on Saturday as they headed towards this small town on the 10th anniversary of the death of Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess.</p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Benta Sessa told a news conference those arrested in Copenhagen and Roskilde were 11 neo-Nazis carrying knives, petrol bombs or other illegal weapons on their way to a Hess memorial march, 12 anarchists planning protests against the march and one other person.</p>
<p>About 170 neo-Nazis, many of them wearing hoods, had boarded a train headed for Roskilde, a quiet cathedral town west of Copenhagen where the march was planned.</p>
<p>Two of the arrested neo-Nazis were Norwegians and three German neo-Nazis had been turned back at the German border, Sessa said.</p>
<p>Liberal freedom of speech laws have made Denmark something of a neo-Nazi haven, to the irritation of neighbouring Germany, where Nazi tracts and symbols are banned, and to the discomfort of Danes who remember wartime Nazi occupation.</p>
<p>German police are also bracing for clashes with neo-Nazi groups throughout the weekend of the Hess anniversary.</p>
<p>A force of 800 officers has streamed into Roskilde to keep the two sides apart. Police carrying tear gas guarded all entries to the town, scrutinising vehicles and checking their occupants.</p>
<p>A 1995 march in the town turned into a violent rout when neo-Nazis were scattered by a far larger group of leftists.</p>
<p>The heaviest concentration of police was around the central railway station where officers told Reuters they feared rival groups arriving by train might clash.</p>
