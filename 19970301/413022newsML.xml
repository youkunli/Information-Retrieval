<p>Fourteen teenagers were in Boston-area hospitals Saturday after falling sick late Friday at a dance where they apparently ingested muscle relaxant pills, police said.</p>
<p>Their condition ranged from serious to critical, according to Woburn Police officer Paul Lucero.</p>
<p>Police found some of the muscle relaxants, called baclosen, and an empty bottle at the &quot;Teen Supreme&quot; dance at the Boys and Girls Club in Woburn, Mass., about 20 miles north of Boston.</p>
<p>&quot;They were passing out the pills and they just started falling,&quot; Lucero told Reuters.</p>
<p>Most of the victims were girls, he said. The Boston Globe reported Saturday that most of the victims were eighth grade girls from Kennedy Junior High School in Woburn.</p>
<p>Seven victims were transferred to Children's Hospital in Boston, Lucero said. Others were taken to Lahey Hitchcock Medical Centre in Burlington, north of Boston.</p>
