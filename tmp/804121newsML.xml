<p>Cosmonauts aboard the Russian Mir space station checked spacesuits on Saturday that they will don next week to make repairs to the fault-prone complex, officials said. They also prepared to carry out a redocking manoeuvre with an old supply module on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Because it's the weekend, they don't have a full-up work day today,&quot; Christine Chiodo, NASA lead operations officer at Mission Control outside Moscow, said. &quot;They did some check up on their spacesuits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Later the ground crew will give them information on the Progress redocking,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Mir plans to redock with the seven-metre (23-foot) long, 7,200 kgo (15,800 pound) Progress resupply ship on Sunday at 5:55 p.m. Moscow time (1355 GMT).</p>
<p>The manouevre repeats the procedure that was carried out on June 25 when a different Progress vehicle collided with Mir in the worst accident in the station's 11-year history. On Sunday however, Mir will attempt the docking in automatic rather than manual pilot.</p>
<p>The Progress delivered oxygen, food water and tools to Mir on July 7 after the accident, which caused a major loss of power aboard Mir. It undocked on August 6, mostly filled with garbage and old supplies.</p>
<p>Space officials said redocking a trash-filled module helps Mir by providing balance for the station and by protecting the hatch from prolonged solar exposure.</p>
<p>In its latest status report on the situation aboard Mir, NASA said that Russian flight controllers have established that the space station has enough drinking water to last until late October.</p>
<p>NASA said the arrival of the U.S. space shuttle in late September and a new Progress resupply ship in late September or early October would bring more water supplies.</p>
<p>The crew also did not have to worry about its oxygen supply, since its Elektron oxygen regenerating system was repaired on Thursday after a two-week effort just as the old crew was returning to earth.</p>
<p>On Friday, the crew, made up of commander Anatoly Solovyov, flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov, and British-born U.S. astronaut Michael Foale, circled Mir for 45 minutes in the Soyuz escape capsule filming and photographing the exterior in preparation for risky repair work.</p>
<p>Russian flight director Vladimir Solovyov told reporters the crew did not immediately spot any holes in the punctured Spektr module. The crew was expected to transmit a copy of the video to earth on Monday for flight controllers to take a closer look.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, commander Solovyov and Vinogradov plan to put on spacesuits inside the Mir capsule -- a rare proceedure in the history of spaceflight -- and open the hatch to the darkened Spektr.</p>
<p>They will then attempt to attach cables into the module, which will restore much power to Mir, and then reseal Spektr. They hope to patch the puncture in several external spacewalks starting in September.</p>
