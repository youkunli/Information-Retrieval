<p>The U.N. official in charge of humanitarian aid, said on Friday he expected the first food and medical supplies to reach Iraq soon, probably in mid-March.</p>
<p>Undersecretary-General Yasushi Akashi, also told reporters he doubted the amount of oil Iraq could sell would be increased past the $2 billion limit the Security Council had set for the six months.</p>
<p>At issue is a U.N. oil-for-food plan that allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to purchase humanitarian goods for its people suffering from sanctions imposed in August 1990 when Baghdad's troops invaded Kuwait. The program went into effect on Dec. 10 but no food or medicine under the plan has arrived in Iraq yet.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in Paris on Thursday that the first shipments would arrive on Saturday.</p>
<p>Akashi said that had been the target date. But he said some countries on the Security Council did not want distribution to begin until the main complement of U.N. monitors, who are to supervise the distribution were on the ground, which would occur about March 15.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a shortage of money. Until we get a certain amount of money we cannot recruit observers. And certain countries insisted that until we have observers they cannot approve the contracts. We went through a lot of chicken and egg arguments,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Thai rice, Australian wheat, French wheat, Jordanian tea, everything is on the way,&quot; he said. &quot;The ships are under way.&quot;</p>
<p>Akashi also said previous barriers in granting U.N. monitors travel documents and communications equipment had been resolved.</p>
<p>The plan calls for a review every three months at which time U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan can recommend an increase in the oil sold should there not be enough humanitarian supplies to cover basic emergencies.</p>
<p>But most Security Council members have said for months that the resolution authorizing the deal would not be changed until the six months had expired. And with food supplies having been delayed, diplomats said it would be nearly impossible to judge whether the current scheme was adequate.</p>
<p>In Baghdad on Friday Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said that the issue of an increase would be raised with Secretary-General Kofi Annan, presumably after he returns from Europe next week and before he files a report on March 10.</p>
<p>But Akashi said: &quot;I think if we have $2 billion dollars every six months, that is quite sufficient for us to purchase humanitarian goods, providing we get this machinery on track and we are getting there.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, whom he saw on Friday, did not raise the issue with him. Instead he said al-Sahaf spoke about the delay in the approval of contracts and how the money should allocated for those contracts that had been turned down.</p>
<p>Rasheed noted that Iraq was receiving only $660 million out of every $1 billion of oil sold &quot;which is not enough to meet the very minimum basic needs of its people. About 30 percent of the revenues goes to victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion and U.N. costs.</p>
<p>He said that was &quot;not enough to meet the very minimum basic needs of the people.&quot;</p>
