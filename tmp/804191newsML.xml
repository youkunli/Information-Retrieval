<p>Iran has removed Tehran's police chief after his forces came under widespread criticism over the case of a serial killer dubbed the ''Tehran Vampire&quot;.</p>
<p>The daily Hamshahri said on Saturday Tehran police chief Brigadier General Youssef Reza Abolfathi had now been appointed head of police in the southern Fars province. It did not say if a new police chief had been named for the capital.</p>
<p>Confessed serial killer Gholamreza Khoshrou Kouran Kordieh, 28, was hanged from a mobile crane in Tehran on Wednesday after confessing on television to the kidnap, rape and murder of nine girls and women aged 10 to 47 in four months this year.</p>
<p>The man, dubbed &quot;the Tehran Vampire&quot; because he carried out his crimes at night, was convicted by a court this month.</p>
<p>Newspapers had heavily criticised the police for failing to warn citizens the serial killer was on the loose during his four-month crime spree in one western Tehran suburb and for mistakenly reporting at first that he was an Afghan.</p>
