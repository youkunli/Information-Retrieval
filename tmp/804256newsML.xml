<p>Suspected Moslem guerrillas have killed 15 people, including young children, in the latest series of attacks on civilians in Algeria, Algerian newspapers reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen people, including six children and two women, were victims of a massacre near Douera, in Blida area on Thursday,&quot; al-Khabar newspaper said.</p>
<p>According to Le Matin daily, the children were aged between six months and three years.</p>
<p>Blida is considered as a stronghold of Moslem fundamentalist rebels where dozens of civilians have been killed in recent months.</p>
<p>The official media, including the state-run APS news agency did not mention Douera's killing so far.</p>
<p>According to independent sources an estimated 440 people have been killed in the past four weeks by the rebels in different areas of the country.</p>
<p>More than 60,000 people have died in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead.</p>
