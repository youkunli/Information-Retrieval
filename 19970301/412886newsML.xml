<headline>Mexico drugs capo walks from jail, probe ordered.</headline>

<p>A top Mexican drug lord escaped from police custody just as the United States was deciding whether to certify if Mexico was cooperating in the fight against drugs, authorities said on Friday.</p>
<p>Humberto Garcia Abrego, who is accused of money-laundering and is the brother of jailed Mexico Gulf cartel chief Juan Garcia Abrego, walked out of installations of the National Institute for Combatting Drugs late on Thursday or early Friday, the Attorney General's Office said in a statement. A probe has been launched.  </p>
<p>The statement said Garcia was initially legally released from custody just before midnight on Tuesday (0600 GMT Wednesday) after winning a court order protecting him from illegal arrest from a judge in Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>Authorities immediately took him back into custody, however, to answer a &quot;presentation order&quot; requiring him to testify about other outstanding laundering and criminal association charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Inexplicably the official in charge of the investigation told his superiors that Humberto Garcia Abrego had 'gone from the National Institute for Combatting Drugs' before the investigation was completed,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The official in question and his colleagues -- who are now being interrogated -- had 48 hours to question Garcia from the time of his detention before having to release or arrest him, and by failing to do so allowed him to walk free. The announcement of his escape was made several hours after Washington certified that Mexico was cooperating as an ally in the war on drugs despite strong opposition from critics of Mexican drug corruption.</p>
