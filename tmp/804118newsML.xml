<p>Romania's government has postponed until next week the replacement of the oversized state National Oil Company (CRP) with a new firm acceptable to international lenders, top officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We failed to reach an agreement. We hope to finalise the talks by next Tuesday or Thursday,&quot; Industry Minister Calin Tariceanu told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Saturday.</p>
<p>Last month, the new centrist government announced plans to dismantle the CRP holding which groups the country's 10 refineries, four transport and 41 oil distribution companies, and replace it with a new and more efficient company.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have to make some economic and financial evaluations,&quot; Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said.</p>
<p>CRP was created in 1995 by the former leftist government, which hoped it could provide funds to import crude oil badly needed by Romania's industrial and energy sectors as well as streamline the exploration, refining and transport of oil.</p>
<p>&quot;The CRP is a non-functional structure. It has to go,&quot; CRP President Vifor Ionita said.</p>
<p>The move to dismantle the CRP is also in line with suggestions made by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for the government to shut unviable oil companies operating at a loss and streamline the oil processing sector.</p>
<p>Romania's refining industry, with a capacity of 34 million tonnes a year, inherited form the former communist regime, is the largest in central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>But some officials in the oil sector said they opposed recommendations made by the World Bank to include only one refinery in the new company.</p>
<p>&quot;The World Bank's idea to have only one refinery is not exactly the best. One can't play with Romania's energy security,&quot; an official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gheorghe Popa, the chairman of Petrom RA oil exploration authority, said under initial plans the new company to replace the CRP would include Petrom, two refineries with a total capacity of seven million tonnes per year as well as some 40 percent of the PECO SA petroleum products retailer.</p>
<p>Plans to include a third refinery in the new firm were also under consideration, he said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ciorbea said the government had so far opted for the Petrobrazi SA refinery, in the oilfield of Ploiesti.</p>
<p>&quot;Petrobrazi is in the centre of Romania's main oilfield, so it was natural to include it in the new company,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Both he and Tariceanu refused to elaborate on the structure of the new oil firm or the number of its refineries.</p>
<p>&quot;There are still divergent opinions. I think it is important to have a solid decision on the issue, having in mind the special importance of the sector,&quot; Tariceanu said.</p>
