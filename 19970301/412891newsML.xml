<headline>Mexico leader visits Nobel laureate Paz in hospital.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-02-28</dateline>

<p>President Ernesto Zedillo on Friday visited ailing Nobel poet laureate Octavio Paz, who entered a hospital five days ago for what was at first described as a checkup, state news agency Notimex said.</p>
<p>Notimex said Zedillo spoke briefly with Paz, 82, but it gave no further information. A hospital worker confirmed the visit but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>On Thursday Paz's magazine, Vuelta, issued a statement that said he was undergoing some clinical tests but was healthy and expected to return to his normal activities shortly.</p>
<p>When Notimex initially reported Paz's admission into a hospital on Monday, it said he was depressed following a fire at his home in December which destroyed a precious collection of his books and artefacts. The fire was caused by a short circuit in a television set.</p>
<p>Paz, who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1990, is considered one of Mexico's finest poets. He also wrote &quot;The Labyrinth of Solitude&quot;, his best-known and most controverisal work that takes a critical look at the Mexican personality.</p>
<p>He suffers from phlebitis, which causes blood circulation problems and restricts his mobility.</p>
