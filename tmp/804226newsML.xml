<p>Fathers who stay at home with their children are less concerned with career progress but more worried about how they would return to the workforce than mothers who stay at home, U.S. researchers said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Drs. Robert Frank of Loyola University and Michael Helford of DePaul University, who surveyed a group of primary caregiving fathers and mothers in 1994 and 1996, said they had not researched why so-called &quot;stay-at-home dads&quot; were less worried about career development than stay-at-home moms.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't know why,&quot; Helford told reporters at the American Psychology Association's annual convention here.</p>
<p>He said one possibility was that if the men were more committed to the role of primary caregiver, &quot;they've kind of forgotten about their career for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>He explained that people in that kind of mindset would find it more difficult going back to work.</p>
<p>The researchers said they would study that question in follow-up surveys.</p>
<p>Other studies have shown that breaking up a career does more harm to men's income than women's, Helford said.</p>
<p>In 1994, the researchers surveyed 49 stay-at-home dads and 44 stay-at-home moms. In 1996, the survey population was increased to 371 and 490, respectively.</p>
<p>They found in both studies that while children were more attached to the mother when she was the primary caregiver, they were equally attached to both parents when the father was the primary caregiver.</p>
<p>&quot;If the child gets hurt, if the child wakes up in the middle of the night, he goes to either the mother or the father -- it's a 50/50 split in a stay-at-home dad family,&quot; Frank said.</p>
<p>&quot;In a traditional family it's 80/20, they always go to the mother and rarely go to the father,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Helford said the fact that reversing traditional caregiver roles did not lead to a &quot;symmetrical&quot; role reversal for fathers and mothers was one of the most surprising results of the study.</p>
<p>Another instance of the &quot;assymetrical&quot; role reversal was that stay-at-home fathers did not relinquish all their traditional roles, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Primary caregiving fathers do the same household activities as stay-at-home moms, including feeding, dressing and changing diapers, but they also do their more traditional jobs like household maintenance and repair.</p>
<p>Frank said one of the report's conclusions was that while society is growing more accomodating to fathers who stay at home with their children, stereotypes die hard.</p>
