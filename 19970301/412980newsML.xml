<p>A Japanese government envoy will meet Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri on Monday to discuss the issue of suspected Red Army members reported held in Lebanon, Beirut's official news agency reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The National News Agency (NNA) said Japanese envoy Hiroshi Hirabayashi would arrive in Beirut on Sunday and meet Hariri a day later &quot;to discuss with him the issue of the detainees who are believed to be Japanese&quot;.</p>
<p>Judicial sources said on Friday that Lebanese authorities have started interrogating nine or 10 detainees -- mostly Asians, in the case, including three Japanese.</p>
<p>The case has been shrouded in confusion since February 18 when Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in Tokyo that Lebanese officials had told him six Japanese Red Army suspects had been arrested in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.</p>
<p>Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bouez had confirmed the arrests but days later Interior Minister Michel al-Murr and Lebanese security sources said no Lebanese security or military intelligence agency was holding any Japanese detainees. Judicial sources said then they were sure Syrian troops in Lebanon were not holding the Japanese.</p>
<p>The Red Army, founded in 1971, is allied to hardline anti-Israeli Palestinian factions.</p>
