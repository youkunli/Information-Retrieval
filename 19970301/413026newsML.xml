<p>A federal jury on Friday convicted several anti-government militia members of possessing pipe bombs and machine guns but were unable to agree on whether they engaged in a conspiracy to kill federal agents.</p>
<p>After a five-week trial and eight days of jury deliberation, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour declared a mistrial on the most serious conspiracy counts against the seven defendants, members of the anti-government Freemen and Washington State Militia.</p>
<p>He ordered federal prosecutors to decide quickly whether to retry the defendants, including John Pitner, self-declared director of the state militia.</p>
<p>Pitner, 45, and the six other defendants were arrested July 27 in Seattle and Bellingham, where agents found pipe bombs and other explosive devices allegedly made by members of the group.</p>
<p>Federal agents arrested five members of the group at a bomb-making class after a seven-month undercover investigation.</p>
<p>Defence attorneys argued that the defendants were coerced into making the explosives by the undercover agents, and they said their clients were tried for their unpopular beliefs.</p>
<p>&quot;Our position was these people talked a lot, but there was no conspiracy to kill or impede the federal government,&quot; said Robert Leen, attorney for one of the defendants.</p>
<p>According to trial testimony, two of the self-described Freemen had approached the militia members for training with the objective of travelling to Jordan, Montana, during the FBI siege of a foreclosed ranch.</p>
<p>The Freemen received limited training, include practice shooting at targets representing federal agents and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.</p>
<p>But when the 81-day standoff ended peacefully, the project was dropped.</p>
<p>Coughenour ordered two defendants -- who faced only conspiracy charges -- to be released after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked.</p>
<p>Pitner was found guilty of possessing a machine gun, as was Gary Kuehnoel, 47, Marlin Mack, 24, and John Kirk, 56, were found guilty of possessing pipe bombs or other destructive devices.</p>
<p>An eighth defendant pleaded guilty previously.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for federal prosecutors said a decision on whether to seek a retrial would be made within two weeks.</p>
