<headline>Teamsters, UPS in marathon talks to end strike.</headline>

<p>Negotiators for United Parcel Service and the Teamsters union worked around-the-clock on Saturday in an effort to reach a settlement that would end a strike against the giant package delivery firm.</p>
<p>But it was uncertain whether the two sides moved any closer to agreement and ending the 13-day-old strike by 185,000 UPS workers that has paralyzed the nation's largest package delivery firm.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for chief federal mediator John Calhoun Wells and Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who was in the room with negotiators on Saturday, declined to say whether any progress had been made in more than 30 hours of virtually non-stop talks.</p>
<p>Teamsters spokesman Steve Trossman said, &quot;I haven't heard there has been any change since (Teamsters President Ron Carey's) news conference (Friday), but they continue to talk.&quot;</p>
<p>A UPS spokeswoman in Atlanta said it was &quot;a positive sign they (the talks) have continued. I'm sure they will go on as long as both parties believe they are going well.&quot;</p>
<p>Negotiators met through the night on Friday at a Washington hotel near the Capitol and only took a short break in the predawn hours on Saturday to freshen up and take naps before resuming talks.</p>
<p>&quot;They're hunkered down,&quot; a Labor Department spokesman said. &quot;They just took a few hours off.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest round of informal talks began on Thursday at the urging of Herman. President Bill Clinton has been resisting calls by UPS and some business groups to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act that would end the strike.</p>
<p>In a letter to Clinton, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged intervention, saying he was the only person who could help &quot;thousands of struggling employers and employees all across the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Each day that the Teamsters strike against UPS is allowed to continue, the devastating impact on America's small business escalates ... without immediate relief from this strike these 'mom and pop' operations cannot long survive,&quot; the letter said.</p>
<p>On Friday, Herman spokeswoman Susan King said UPS and the nation's second-largest union redoubled their efforts to reach a settlement in meetings that were at times face-to-face and at other times held in separate rooms with mediators shuttling between them.</p>
<p>Carey praised Herman and Wells for their &quot;superb job&quot; in keeping the talks alive.</p>
<p>But he said no agreements had been reached on any of the issues in the dispute and announced plans for rallies in 30 U.S. cities next week to drum up support for the 185,000 UPS workers on strike. He said unions representing UPS workers in several European countries also were planning job actions.</p>
<p>Clearly buoyed by opinion polls showing the strikers winning the lion's share of public support, Carey declared his resolve not to back down from the union's demand that UPS convert more part-time jobs into higher paying full-time jobs.</p>
<p>CNN said a poll taken with the Gallup Organization showed 55 percent of Americans supporting the Teamsters.</p>
<p>The UPS workers have been on strike since Aug. 4 to demand full-time status and benefits for some of the company's many part-time employees. A key company demand has been to withdraw from its current multi-employer pension plans and set up a plan solely for Teamster members at UPS.</p>
<p>The walkout is the biggest since a three-day strike by 400,000 Teamster truckers in 1976, according to Richard Hurd, director of labor studies at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations.</p>
<p>The strikers were getting help from other unions, but were finding it tough to live on $55-a-week strike benefits, while the company estimated $300 million in lost revenue a week, putting its losses so far at about $500 million or more.</p>
<p>UPS competitors, including the U.S. Postal Service, have rushed to try to fill the void, but many small businesses are feeling the pinch of being unable to deliver their goods.</p>
