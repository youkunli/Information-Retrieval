<p>Australian number three Matthew Elliott failed by 15 runs to reach his maiden test century as his side allowed their powerful advantage to slip on the second day of the first test against South Africa on Saturday.</p>
<p>Replying to South Africa's 302 all out Australia had reached 189 for four wickets at tea.</p>
<p>Resuming after lunch on 93 for one, Elliott and opener Matthew Hayden took their second wicket partnership to 95 before fast bowler Shaun Pollock induced an edge from Hayden that was well caught by Daryll Cullinan at slip.</p>
<p>Hayden departed for 40 with the score at 128 for two and 41 runs later Mark Waugh attempted an ambitious pull from outside off stump against Allan Donald. Another thin edge was held low down by wicket keeper Dave Richardson.</p>
<p>With Mark Waugh departing for 26 from just 34 balls with four boundaries, Elliott played another pull shot against Donald but was not in position to cope with the extra bounce and succeeded only in splicing a simple catch to mid on.</p>
<p>Elliott's 85 spanned two hours and 42 minutes and came from 113 balls with 12 fours and a powerful flat six over square leg -- also off Donald.</p>
<p>Steve Waugh survived a straighforward run out chance before he had scored when Pollock lobbed his return high over Richardson's head and Greg Blewett was forced to live through a torrid spell from Donald half an hour before tea.</p>
<p>Earlier Mark Taylor's miserable recent form continued when he edged a ball from Pollock on to his stumps for 16. It was his 16th consecutive test innings without a half century.</p>
<p>At tea Steve Waugh was on 14 and Blewett on one.</p>
