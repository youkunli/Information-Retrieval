<p>Even when he was the victim of a knife attack, double Olympic champion Alexander Popov could manage a joke.</p>
<p>Popov, recovered in body and relaxed and full of good humour before his European title defences, on Saturday recalled the night in Moscow last August when he was stabbed by a water melon seller in a street altercation.</p>
<p>Popov, who has twice achieved Olympic 50 and 100 metres freestyle title doubles, said a group of the fruit sellers had started a fight with a friend of his.</p>
<p>&quot;I tried to calm them down but they were like bulls in a fight,&quot; he said. &quot;Even when I got stabbed I was still walking around, making jokes.&quot;</p>
<p>It was only after his friend said he could not walk that Popov told him: 'I've been stabbed. Stop a car and go to hospital'.</p>
<p>&quot;The knife entered between the eighth and ninth or ninth and 10th ribs and went up 15 centimetres.&quot; It touched his kidney, lung and diaphragm.</p>
<p>&quot;I lost about six or seven kilos in hospital and it took about six or seven months to put it back on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My soul was not damaged. The body is like a frame. The doctors got their welding machine and there you go,&quot; he added with a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;When you are under a general anaesthetic the doctors can do anything they like. They can put a jet engine in you, they can put an extra fuel tank in you. I don't think that the accident is going to affect my results, training or career.&quot;</p>
<p>Popov returned to his base in Australia and got back in the water in November, although he did not start training seriously until April.</p>
<p>He married fellow swimmer Daria Shmeleva in March and they expect a baby later this year. He has also been baptised into the Russian Orthodox church since his stabbing.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought God has given me success with one hand and maybe the devil gives me the same amount of bad luck with the other hand. Maybe it's time to get in touch with God,&quot; he said. &quot;Now I feel I'm pure, pure Russian with the traditions of thousands of years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>In the pool he has worked hard: &quot;I knew it was going to be tough...I knew there was going to be a lot of pain but 'No pain, no Spain'.&quot;</p>
<p>He suffered a rare beating by Olympic bronze medallist Gustavo Borges in Brazil in July but faces all challenges with the supreme confidence which has carried him to victory in all his major championships since 1991.</p>
<p>Huge progressions by young Americans Scott Tucker and Neil Walker, who have elbowed Olympic silver medallist Gary Hall out of next year's world championship team, leave him unfazed.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got another American generation to break and we'll do it,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they're super talented, maybe they're from another planet. We'll just break them mentally, easy.&quot;</p>
<p>All said with a grin, there was no conceited posturing from the man who has won four Olympic, two world and five European individual titles but admits he was scared of the water as a child.</p>
