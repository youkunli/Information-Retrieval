<p>World 100 metres champion Maurice Greene suffered his second defeat over the distance in four days on Saturday when he was beaten by fellow American Tim Montgomery at the Monaco grand prix.</p>
<p>Greene, who finished behind Namibia's Frankie Fredericks in Zurich on Wednesday in his first major race since this month's world championships in Athens, could not match Montgomery's strong finish and had to settle for third.</p>
<p>Montgomery, who claimed bronze in Athens, clocked a stadium record of 9.99 seconds to beat American Dennis Mitchell (10.05) with Greene one hundredth of a second further behind on a warm evening on the Cote d'Azur which was perfect for sprinting.</p>
<p>With world record holder Donovan Bailey absent and Fredericks preferring the 200, the 23-year-old Greene will need to win races like this before he can claim to be the world's top sprinter. He left the track shaking his head.</p>
<p>Compatriot Marion Jones, the world champion who also lost her first 100 race since Athens to veteran Merlene Ottey in Zurich, bounced back to beat the Jamaican in the 200 metres in 21.92. Ottey was second in 22.06.</p>
<p>Fredericks won the men's event in 19.94, beating a tired-looking Ato Boldon, the world champion, into second place</p>
<p>Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, who smashed Seb Coe's 16-year-old 800 metres world record in Zurich on Wednesday when he clocked a historic one minute 41.24 seconds, was clearly not in record-breaking mood although he won the night's 800m in a sharp 1:42.77.</p>
<p>Kipketer took off on his own with 200 to go to finish strongly but said: &quot;After Zurich it was too close to run a world record.&quot;</p>
<p>In the women's two-lap race Mozambique's Maria Mutola produced another powerful finish to defeat Cuban world champion Ana Fidelia Quirot. Mutola clocked 1:56.79 with Quirot second in 1:56.90.</p>
<p>France's world 400 metres hurdles champion Stephane Diagana suffered defeat at the hands of American world bronze medallist Bryan Bronson, who ran 47.64, the fastest time in the world this year.</p>
<p>Diagana tried to find an extra kick after the final hurdle but was unable to stop Bronson gaining some consolation for his defeat in Athens. The Frenchman took second in 47.77.</p>
<p>&quot;I started too slowly and by the time I had reached the 10th hurdle, I knew that it was impossible to catch Bronson,&quot; said Diagana.</p>
<p>In the women's 400 hurdles American world record holder Kim Batten also won a tight race with Jamaica's Olympic champion Deon Hemmings in 53.06 seconds. Hemmings, the silver medallist in Athens, pushed the American all the way down the home straight but could only take second in 53.22.</p>
