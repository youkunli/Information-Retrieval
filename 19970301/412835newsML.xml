<p>Political protest exploded into bloody violence in the southern Albanian town of Vlore on Friday night. Four people were killed -- one of them a policeman who witnesses said was dragged into a street and beaten to death by a mob which torched the local headquarters of the secret police.</p>
<p>A14-year-old boy and two other civilians were shot dead in a gunbattle between police and demonstrators touched off by Albania's long-running campaign of anti-government protests, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>Demonstrators, who took arms from the sacked police office, were reported to have blocked routes into the town to hold off police reinforcements.</p>
<p>Two other police officers beaten by the mob were in a serious condition, the hospital official said.</p>
<p>The shooting began after an incident outside the university in which a protester suffered stab wounds. He was treated is wounds in the hospital and later released.</p>
<p>The hospital said Fatmir Tozaj, 34, Shkelqim Bogdani, 33, and Artur Zoto, 14, had been shot dead.</p>
<p>Demonstrators have staged anti-government marches in the ancient town every day for the past three weeks and 42 students have been on hunger strike there for 10 days in protest against the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which has left thousands penniless.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the atmosphere turned violent when protesters heard that a group of Vlore students travelling to the southern town of Gjirokaster near the Greek border had been detained by police in the town of Ballsh.</p>
<p>They were questioned for four hours and later released but their detention was enough to inflame the already tense atmosphere prevailing in the town.</p>
<p>A group of 43 students in Gjirokaster have also begun a hunger strike as part of a wave of university and high school protests across the Balkan state staged in solidarity with Vlore.</p>
<p>Vlore has been a focus of street protests since one man was shot dead and two others died of heart attack in clashes there on February 10.</p>
<p>Protesters seized weapons, including handguns, machine guns, grenades and ammunition at the police headquarters before torching the building.</p>
<p>Scores of people were also reported to have piled into cars to try to secure a road bridge at Mifoli, 20 km (12 miles) north of Vlore -- the only route into the port town in an apparent attempt to halt any police reinforcements from the north reaching Vlore.</p>
