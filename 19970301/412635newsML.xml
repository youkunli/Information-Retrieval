<p>Spain were trailing Belgium 1-0 in their Fed Cup tennis world group one match on Saturday after Arantxa Sanchez Vicario crashed to a shock 6-3 7-6 defeat by Belgian substitute Els Callens.</p>
<p>It was the second loss to a Belgian in two months for the former world number one, who clumsily hit a forehand long on the second matchpoint for Callens, who took the tie-break 7-4.</p>
<p>Sanchez Vicario had been keen to avenge her defeat to another Belgian, Dominique Van Roost, in the third round of this year's Australian Open.</p>
<p>But Van Roost pulled out on Friday because of the abdomen injury which had forced her to retire in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, and was replaced by Callens.</p>
<p>Spain have won the Cup four times in the past six years including victories over the United States in 1991, 1994 and 1995.</p>
<p>They are also without Conchita Martinez, who formed with Sanchez Vicario the most successful doubles combination in Cup history. Martinez has tendinitis in her right shoulder.</p>
