<p>Three firms that tried to control red bean contract prices on the Tianjin United Futures Exchange have been banned from trading by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Shanghai Securities News said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The banned companies were also fined up to four million yuan ($482,000) each, while firms that acted in concert with them were ordered to retire from the Tianjin exchange, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It said the three member companies of the Tianjin futures exchange together raised 280 million yuan in cash, which was used to overbuy the September 1996 red bean contract.</p>
<p>The beans were then stored in an effort to force the price up, it said.</p>
<p>The warrant for the red bean contract was passed to another group of companies that broke regulations by using it as collateral to raise 230 million yuan, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The money was then used to control the price of other red bean contracts on the exchange.</p>
<p>The three banned companies were also found to have improperly used other companies' seats on the Tianjin United Futures Exchange, it said.  </p>
<p>Some of the companies implicated in the scheme refused to cooperate with the Commission's investigation, it said.</p>
<p>The banned companies, whose managers were also barred, were Tianjin Metal Materials Products Co, Xinxinhang (Tianjin) International Trading Co Ltd and Tianjin Tianli Cereals, Oils and Local Products Production Co Ltd, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Tianjin Metal Materials Products Co was fined four million yuan, and the other two companies were fined two million yuan each, it said.</p>
<p>Another five companies involved in the scheme were ordered not to open any new trading accounts, to clear all their current accounts within 20 trading days and to retire from the Tianjin exchange, it said.</p>
<p>It said other irregularities on the Tianjin United Futures Exchange were being handled seperately, but gave no details.</p>
