<p>Seven more Indonesian policemen will be tried on charges of involvement in the beating of an Islamic religious teacher which sparked a riot in West Java, the Merdeka newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The paper quoted chief of the military high prosecutor's office Colonel Ismail Bangun as saying on Friday the dossiers of the seven would be submitted to a military tribunal soon.</p>
<p>The paper gave no other details.</p>
<p>On Friday, four policemen were sentenced to between 10 months and a little over two years for the beating of teacher Mahmud Farid and two students during an interrogation in Tasikmalaya in late December.</p>
<p>The four had already been discharged from the police for their actions.</p>
<p>Military prosecutors said the policemen beat the three after the son of the main defendant was punished for stealing money from other students in the Moslem boarding school where Farid taught.</p>
<p>Reports of the beating spread in Tasikmalaya and a mob of mainly Moslem youths later burned shops, police stations and churches. Four people died in the disturbance.</p>
<p>Authorities have said 22 civilians will soon be tried for taking part in the riot. One of the accused has been charged with subversion, which carries a possible death penalty.</p>
