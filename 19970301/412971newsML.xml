<p>Rescue workers battled freezing conditions on Saturday to help survivors of three earthquakes that rumbled across Asia, killing at least 550 people.</p>
<p>The deadliest quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, left 500 dead and 2,000 injured in northwestern Iran on Friday.</p>
<p>Deputy Interior Minister Rasoul Zargar told Iranian television 3,000 relief workers had completed their rescue efforts and would set up temporary shelters for the 35,000 people left homeless in the mountainous region.</p>
<p>The earthquake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, hit the city of Ardabil and the town of Meshkinshahr at 4.27 p.m. (1257 GMT) on Friday, causing heavy damage to some 83 neighbouring villages, Zargar said.</p>
<p>Zargar, who heads the relief operation, said 719 of the injured had been hospitalised.</p>
<p>Hours before the Iranian tremor, more than 50 people died and 100 were injured when another quake, measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale, jolted Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, bordering Iran and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>A third earthquake, measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, rocked northwestern China on Saturday, killing at least two people and injuring three in an area where about 50 people died in a tremor in January, officials said.</p>
<p>Officials at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Centre in Golden, Colorado, had said they saw no link between the first two quakes.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they're related at all,&quot; Director Waverly Person said. &quot;Both areas are active seismically,&quot; he said, adding that the timing was a coincidence.</p>
<p>Relief workers set up 2,500 tents to shelter thousands of families made homeless and distributed blankets, food, heaters and lanterns, the Iranian news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>Ardabil is an agricultural province inhabited mainly by Iran's Azeri minority. It is one of Iran's coldest regions, with freezing temperatures during the winter. Tehran Radio said snow in mountainous areas was hampering rescue operations.</p>
<p>Icy conditions were also a problem for relief workers in Baluchistan, and bad weather delayed a visit to the area by Pakistan's new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>
<p>The private Edhi ambulance centre in Quetta, the provincial capital, reported 65 deaths, and local newspapers put the figure at up to 100.</p>
<p>The officials said the death toll could rise beyond 50 as information on casualties had still not been received from some stricken villages in the difficult mountainous terrain, where mudslides had blocked road access to some 250 trapped families.</p>
<p>The authorities have sent four-wheel drive vehicles to remote villages in the worst-hit Harnai sub-district with food, medicines tents and volunteer doctors, they said.</p>
<p>Quetta was destroyed by an earthquake on May 31, 1935 that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and killed 30,000 people.</p>
<p>The third quake jolted Jiashi county in the northwestern region of Xinjiang at 2.04 p.m. (0604 GMT) on Saturday, an official with the local office of the State Seismological Bureau said.</p>
<p>The tremor badly frightened the district's residents, many of whom are sheep herders or cotton farmers, and sent people spilling out into the streets, said one official with a local television station.</p>
<p>&quot;It was really strong. Our building and everything in it was rattling, the building shook really fiercely,&quot; the television official said.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone ran out of their houses in terror, but most went back inside when it stopped shaking,&quot; she said, adding that many buildings around her office building had cracked, though none had collapsed.</p>
<p>Many of the area's residents lived in earthen houses that are easily damaged by earthquakes and the casualty toll could rise, the Urumqi official said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not yet sure how many houses have collapsed. We only know initially that there were maybe more than 1,500 houses,&quot; the Jiashi official said. &quot;Houses that are a bit shoddy might be done for now and are not fit to live in,&quot; she said.</p>
