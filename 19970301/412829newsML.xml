<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin stepped up pressure on his government on Saturday over unpaid wages as speculation mounted about a cabinet reshuffle next week.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, keen to reassert his authority in the Kremlin after months of illness, has made clear he is dissatisfied with the government's failure to tackle wage and pension arrears and wants cabinet changes to help defuse rising social tensions.</p>
<p>The president, recently recovered from open heart surgery and a bout of pneumonia, issued a decree ordering the government to pay salaries on time.</p>
<p>&quot;The Government of the Russian Federation shall ensure the unconditional allocation each month to subjects of the Russian Federation money...on the terms set by the Federal Law on the 1997 Federal Budget,&quot; the decree said.</p>
<p>The text of the decree said the aim was to &quot;ensure the constitutional right of citizens to be paid for work and its timely payment and to reduce social tensions&quot;.</p>
<p>The decree appeared partly aimed at distancing Yeltsin from one of Russia's most pressing social problems -- a huge backlog of wages in the state sector, often stretching back many months, that has triggered angry protests across the vast country.</p>
<p>Trade unions are threatening a day of nationwide protests on March 27 and on Saturday the communist chairman of the State Duma lower house of parliament predicted the rising tensions would force a vigorous shake-up in the government.</p>
<p>&quot;President Yeltsin needs to let off the steam of popular discontent and therefore I think we will have very serious cabinet changes,&quot; Gennady Seleznyov told reporters.</p>
<p>Seleznyov said he thought Yegor Stroyev, head of the Federation Council upper house of parliament, might replace Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister.</p>
<p>Speculation has raged over the past week about whether Chernomyrdin, a loyal Yeltsin ally who has headed the government for more than four years, would survive the next shake-up.</p>
<p>On Friday Yeltsin criticised the 1997 budget and vowed to play a bigger role in mapping out next year's spending plans.</p>
<p>However he did not directly criticise Chernomyrdin, who stood in for him while he was preparing for and then recovering from open heart surgery. Chernomyrdin, 59, is widely seen as a symbol of stability in Russia's turbulent political scene.</p>
<p>On Saturday Seleznyov repeated the communists' strong opposition to Kremlin chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais ever becoming prime minister.</p>
<p>Chubais, a liberal who spearheaded Russia's privatisation programme, is hated by the communist and nationalist opposition who accuse him of personally profiting from the market reforms that have left millions of Russians impoverished.</p>
<p>Alexander Lebed, Russia's former security chief who hopes to succeed Yeltsin in the top job, joined the reshuffle debate on Saturday, saying the government would sacrifice several economic ministers and possibly also Defence Minister Igor Rodionov.</p>
<p>Lebed, a charismatic former soldier, said Russia was falling apart and needed a new leader.</p>
<p>&quot;The president is incapable (of working)...He does not rule the country. Russia is about to fall apart. That is why in a choice between a country of 150 million and the president, I choose the country,&quot; Lebed told NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's wife Naina said in a radio interview on Saturday she wanted the members of her husband's team to be &quot;clever people who care about their country&quot;.</p>
