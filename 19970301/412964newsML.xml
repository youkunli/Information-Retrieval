<p>Egyptian and Palestinian presidents on Saturday discussed Israeli plans to build thousands of homes for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem and Egypt's foreign minister said Israel's settlement policy would only lead to destruction.</p>
<p>Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat made no statements after they ended two hours of talks two days before Arafat was due to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters at Ittihadia palace while Arafat and Mubarak were meeting that Israel's settlement policies contravened Israeli-Arab agreements and threatened the peace process.</p>
<p>Israel's approval on Wednesday of a plan to build 6,500 houses in Jabal Abu Ghneim, or Har Homa, has sparked criticism from its key ally the United States and Palestinian warnings that it could unleash bloodshed.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of Jerusalem is very, very touchy. One cannot toy with it,&quot; Moussa said. &quot;There is no escape but to move on all the peace process's tracks and aspects toward normalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;But what's needed is for the two parties to proceed in the same direction, not for Israel to go in a direction which incites people and changes (the status of) Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The issue of settlements is a dangerous one, an issue for which there is no legal basis,&quot; Moussa said. &quot;I don't think the settlement policy would lead to anything but destruction and adversely affect the peace process.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel's settlement plan was also expected to top the agenda of Arafat's talks with Clinton in Washington on Monday.</p>
<p>Arafat has attacked Israel's decision as a breach of peace accords, but he has heeded U.S. warnings to keep the lid on violent protests.</p>
<p>Mubarak said on Thursday that Israel's decision to build the homes for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem could worsen the already tense situation in the occupied territories.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is dangerous and I warn of a deterioration of this situation and of increased difficulties for the peace process,&quot; Mubarak said.</p>
<p>The Egyptian leader said he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone conversation on Wednesday not to take any decision about Jerusalem without first consulting Palestinians. He is expected to meet Netanyahu next week.</p>
<p>The Palestinian cabinet warned that the Israeli plan could threaten Middle East peace.</p>
<p>&quot;The peace process cannot go on under the continuation of this settlement assault which aims to swallow Jerusalem,&quot; the cabinet said in a statement issued on Saturday.</p>
<p>It issued an appeal to world leaders to oppose the Israeli project they fear blocks Palestinian aspirations to turn East Jerusalem into the capital of a future state. In the 1993 Oslo accords Israel and the PLO agreed to discuss the status of the city in a final set of peace talks to end by 1999.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and regards all of the city as its eternal capital, a view unrecognised by the international community.</p>
<p>The Cairo-based Arab League said it would hold an emergency meeting of its permanent representatives to discuss the plan.</p>
